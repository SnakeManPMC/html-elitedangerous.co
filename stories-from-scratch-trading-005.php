<p>
2019-09-16T17:32:05Z new elite day has started, back in Lakon Type-6 cockpit ready to continue trading <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not going to record videos until lateron today, maybe I'll try 60fps again which gave me a lot of performance issues last year.
</p>

<p>
Had to relocate to new trading route again, apparently overnight the one I was using pretty much died. So now off to BD-12 5409 system.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T17:54:09Z docked at BD-12 5409/Slade Orbital, lets start trading. Again I'm not going to write play-by-play here, just important events. Balance now is about 13.9m credits.
</p>

<p>
Had one pirate/killer drop out of supercruise right next to me when I was docking, basically aligning to the mail slot. Another pirate interdicted me but did not start to shoot immediately which must be first in a many many interdictions, I managed to engage FSD back to supercruise which was surprising, didn't take a look what ship it was but usually you are mass locked by them how I understood it that hyper jump to another system is the only real escape. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T19:57:53Z balance 19.7m, was looking at type-7 stock price which is 17.4m so I could easily buy that now and probably could equip it with cargo racks, but dunno how about all the other modules where FSD would be the most expensive and important. Shipyard shows I would get 2.5m from my old ship (in this outfitting config).
</p>

<p>
Decided to do one more cargo run to make sure I got enough cash for decent build. Did that and then plotted route to Sun Takush/McNair Gateway to purchase my next trading ship.
</p>

<p>
When traveling in supercruise in towards mcnair gateway I was interdicted by a pirate, no issue as no cargo.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T20:39:21Z docked at Sun Takush/McNair Gateway, alright lets purchase Lakon Type-7. For some reason I could not name my ship so here is the initial outfitting list for it <a href="https://is.gd/6nzHRt" target="_blank">EDSY.org Lakon Type-7</a>
</p>

<p>
Balance 766.8k credits.
</p>

<p>
"python3 trade.py run +../pmc-type7.txt --cr 766k" says "trade.py: ERROR: Insurance leaves no margin for trade", oops <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It was fairly interesting that I didn't even think of insurance, hmm. Oh well now we do first trade at least without safety net, hopefully everything goes alright.
</p>

<p>
New trade route calculated because now we need large pad only, new era of trading has begin! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
We are going to Limapa/Kovalyonok Port which is 3 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T21:12:47Z docked at Limapa/Kovalyonok Port. Here I saw battle cruiser ship or whatever its called being built, never seen that before so was really surprised that what is this huge thing next to the station, nice.
</p>

<p>
So took my first load of cargo 310 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics which got me 2.5 million credit profit, wow nice, welcome to large scale trading indeed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
On my way to clement city I was interdicted TWICE by the same ship, he started to fire on me even though I was throttle zeroed, got like eighty-some percent hull status damages. Not only that, but when I dropped into clement city from supercruise the same damn AI killer ship appeared again but obviously ran off as he saw the station.
</p>

<p>
This feels like a bug or some mission related "griefer" AI scripted fake interdiction, really odd.
</p>

<p>
After couple of trade runs with 310t cargo capacity, balance 5.973m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to make few more trading hops to get maybe 10m credits or so and then call this fun second account experiment over. I wanted to start from scratch which I did and now I'm about in the same spot as in my previous one so have a good comparison and I am definitely not going to trade until type-9 not to mention start to trade with that, I mean for what... its my second account, its make belief.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T22:07:52Z while departing from the station, just before the mail slot some smaller ship collided with me from behind, 93% hull status.
</p>

<p>
On arrival I was interdicted and again same ship came after me with one interdiction and then threats on radio comms, he even dropped after me on the station, I baited him to attack me outside the no fire zone, he did but once I turned back into the station he break off and jumped away, pussy hehe.
</p>

<p>
Got 3.5k worth of repairs.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T22:18:10Z sold the cargo, balance 11.284m and received trade rank promotion to Broker <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
With this promotion I decided to call it quits for this start from scratch clear save. I recall my previous one had thirteen million credits but I'm close enough to call this even for all those comparisons for years to come.
</p>

<p>
It was fun, especially trading right in the beginning with sidewinder etc where you could count your single credits, once the trading gets into million not to mention billions, it all kind of turns into a big blur. Don't get me wrong my real account has 4.8 billion now which is super cool, but yeah there is something in these start from scratch things heh.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully now I don't need to make another start from scratch in elite for years to come, they really need to change the trading big time until I do so.
</p>

<p>
With that CMDR "Snake Man PMC" signs off and continues his real elite life hehe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
