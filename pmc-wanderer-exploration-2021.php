	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
2021-03-29 Today was odyssey alpha release date. It has nothing to offer for me as the exploration with all systems and old commander snapshot comes at phase 4 which is not even announced yet, today they start to test that stupid first person shooter combat/missions shit.
</p>

<p>
I decided to start loading PMC Wanderer (Q1L-19Z fleet carrier) with tritium and depart to a long exploration journey.

	<h2>2021-03-29 Hauling Tritium</h2>

<p>
2021-03-29T13:24:19Z Booted Elite back up, boarded my PMC Explorer (ASP Explorer), jumped to Pongo/AntonelliCity and then ordered PMC Wanderer to jump there.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-29T13:49:05Z Docked at Pongo/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrived to the system and docked PMC Explorer there. Now need to add tritium buy order and start to haul it myself.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer has now 15t LTDs and 844t tritium in cargo hold, tritium depot 908t. Donated tritium using PMC Trader lakon type-9 and now depot is full and cargo hold 752t.
</p>

<p>
Created tritium buy order of 19385 tons for 103,172 credits per ton. This is 200% of average market price. Then set LTD sell order for 129,288 credits per ton.
</p>

<p>
System chat buy order announcement: PMC Wanderer buying tritium 103k/ton with 19.3k demand. Selling 15t LTDs for 129.2k/ton. Body: Pongo 5.
</p>

<p>
Apparently that didn't work it left out "PMC" from the beginning heh, oh well. I then headed towards antonelli city to buy some tritium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-29T14:07:36Z Docked at Pongo/Antonelli City. Was purchasing tritium... except I forgot my wallet to the carrier <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Meaning my personal account only had 7 million in cash so I could only buy 149t tritium heh. Gotta grab some cash from the carrier. Then purchased full 790t cargo hold of tritium and headed back to PMC Wanderer.

Someone else had sold few tons as the demand was lower upon docking that what it was when I left last time. Nice. System chat is completely dead there is no CMDRs chatting, so must be someone shy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
And now I have to take a break, too much looping it gets boring. Dunno how long will this break last.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-29 Exploration Journey</h2>

<p>
Now I'm going to set course to somewhere "north west" of galaxy coordinates, somewhere along the line of 30k ly / 20k ly I think one of them were negative value I believe the -30k ly.
</p>

<p>
Initially I planned to take PMC Explorer and lead the way, but now it somehow ended up that PMC Trader has quite plenty of tritium cargo so why not use it live as we jump the carrier.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/14177949/name/Phae+Flaae+OO-Z+d13-35" target="_blank">Phae Flaae OO-Z d13-35</a> this is the system name I chosen for anchor point on spansh carrier route planner, I have no intentions to go for this system specifically but just the area that far away, then explore undiscovered virgin systems like I always do.
</p>

<p>
Spansh fleet carrier route planner calculates 78 jumps, estimated time a day, distance jumped 38.3k ly and used tritium fuel 9268t.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier/results/19CB0714-90C8-11EB-A71E-90A194EB4526?destination=Phae%20Flaae%20OO-Z%20d13-35&source=Pongo&tritium_fuel=1000&tritium_market=23950&used_capacity=25000" target="_blank">Spansh carrier route</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lets go <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I kind of regret already to take PMC Trader lakon type-9 with that much tritium in it, one jump is 132t and starts to drop after the first one as carrier weight gets lower. So hmm it will be like 6 jumps, each 20 minutes so yeah I might fall a sleep tonight before I get PMC Trader empty and can switch to PMC Explorer so I could actually do some exploring instead of sitting in the carrier hangar staring a timeout countdowns...
</p>

<p>
Oh well lesson learned for the next trip; do not buy any extra tritium fuel to your refueler tank ship it just doesn't benefit your trip at all.
</p>

<p>
So plan is now to jump as long as I can stay awake or get to switch ships. Below I'll list the time and systems PMC Wanderer jumped.

Then was my first chance to refuel fuel depot from PMC Trader's cargo hold, put in 50t of tritium just enough for next 500ly jump.

</p>

<p>
Donated 130t tritium for another jump. Now PMC Trader cargo hold has only 98t of tritium left, on next jump it needs to tap into carriers cargo hold. After that I could dump whole 1000t into tritium depot and then take out PMC Explorer asp and go explore.
</p>

<p>
But dunno, I'm kind of relaxed now and just like to chill watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bwana" target="_blank">Bwana twitch live stream</a> about odyssey alpha.

</p>

<p>
Donated remaining 98t tritium to fuel depot, then refilled it to full using PMC Trader. Then switched to PMC Explorer, even though I want to chill... I want to explore just a little bit ahead of PMC Wanderer.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T00:40:59Z Traveled one fleet carrier 500ly hop using PMC Explorer asp, found few water worlds and scanned few rings, that took quite a while surprisingly heh.
</p>

<p>
Then sent PMC Wanderer on its way and I remain in PMC Explorer to follow, lets see if I can reach there first <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T01:07:36Z Docked at Blau Euq QR-N d6-54/Q1L-19Z. Stopped by at PMC Wanderer to sell exploration data and send her on her way to the next waypoint. I followed on PMC Explorer.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T02:32:55Z Found earth like and water world in Byaa Eurk GI-B d13-73 system, I was way ahead of PMC Wanderer now so decided to stop here and wait, well I mean continue to next waypoint and wait. Rest of the evening will be just absolute chill watching Bwana's odyssey alpha twitch live stream.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T03:02:27Z Ordered PMC Wanderer to do another jump... but then it was so late for me that I was yawning like crazy, its time to call it a night. Tomorrow will continue for sure.

<p>
2021-03-30T08:28:53Z New Elite day has started, we continue towards our exploration destination area.
</p>

<p>
As a recap, PMC Explorer is now in Byaa Eurk IP-Y b55-0 system, PMC Wanderer is one waypoint behind and unfortunately with only 97t of tritium in fuel depot so I have to actually jump back there with PMC Explorer, switch to PMC Trader and refill that depot. Off we go.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T08:46:44Z Docked at Byaa Eurk XV-L c21-13/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, <a href="edmc.php">EDMC</a> is sending exploration data so I better sell it as well on universal cartographics.
</p>

<p>
Then switched to PMC Trader, filled it up on tritium, refilled carrier fuel depot and plotted the next jump. Then it was breakfast time while watching Elite odyssey twitch live streams while waiting carrier countdown timers <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2021-03-30T11:30:39Z Had to shut it down to take a nap, was snoozing off while watching twitch live stream.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T13:44:36Z Back in Elite, lets continue our exploration journey.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T13:44:25Z Docked at Prieleae SP-G d10-215/Q1L-19Z. This is the system where PMC Wanderer jumped while I went to take a nap, now its fuel depot is down to 8t left so it needs a refill which I did from PMC Trader's cargo, just enough for the next jump, 116t.
</p>

<p>
Currently there was no good twitch live streamers doing odyssey, it was not about odyssey but to watch my favorite streamer play it so I can learn how bad the stupid infantry weapon combat is without needing to try it myself. So I had to watch something else and that got me bored, I wanted to go explore again but at least next jump will be in the hangar.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:04:16Z Docked at Prielo YG-X b56-6/Q1L-19Z. Donated 123t tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:17:47Z Yup I'm bored for twitch streams as there is nothing to watch and I have nothing to do when traveling in this PMC Trader tritium refueling setup, that 20min timer countdown delay is so boring its just unbearable.
</p>

<p>
I have a jump plotted now but once this is done I'll top off tritium in fuel depot and switch back to PMC Explorer and start to jog along the carrier, or perhaps behind her, dunno. Going to grab something to eat now so one more jump after this before switching over, lets hope some good twitch streamer goes live by then hehe.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:25:17Z Docked at Ellaic IF-R c4-75/Q1L-19Z. Donated 121t tritium to fuel depot.

<p>
2021-03-30T14:46:15Z Docked at Ellaic AL-P d5-207/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Topped carrier off with 1000t tritium in the depot, then switched to PMC Explorer asp and went to explore towards the next jump point.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T16:45:37Z Had to restart elite as FSS scanner was really zoomed in and objects squished in it.
</p>

<p>
BTW also really disappointed about odyssey from what I'm seeing from twitch live streams, its mindless COD quake dancing & frag garbage. For me the only thing in odyssey is the walking and new planetary tech (meshes, textures, lighting etc), I will never EVER play those quake dancing & frag bullshit missions, never <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T16:51:11Z Elite restarted and FSS scanner works fine now, we continue.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T17:25:24Z Docked at Blie Phlai LX-L c7-63/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer visit as ... well I'm again getting so bored its just not enjoyable to explore. Need to sell exploration data and <a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a> send it, also one more jump left fuel in carriers tritium depot so need to top that off as well.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T17:45:17Z Docked at Blia Aeb IP-Z c13-63/Q1L-19Z.

	<h2>2021-03-31</h2>

<p>
2021-03-31T01:27:09Z New Elite day has started, we continue flying PMC Wanderer closer to our destination. Should be less than 30 jumps left.
</p>

<p>
We are in Byae Ail OY-N b21-1 system, here I donated 116t tritium to fuel depot before plotting the next jump.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T01:47:17Z Docked at Byae Ail WB-T c17-1/Q1L-19Z. Donated 114t tritium to fuel depot.

2021-03-31T03:32:16Z Docked at Oephonth PI-B d13-60/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time for a little bit of exploration on PMC Exlorer as, I'm so bored of just sitting here jumping especially as twitch live streams ended, or rather my interest for that awful odyssey dancing & frag garbage. I just need to explore some.
</p>

<p>
Dumped 1000t tritium to fuel depot, then switched over to PMC Explorer, plot a next jump for PMC Wanderer and then took off to explore. I let PMC Wanderer to jump ahead of me while I travel galaxy map route filter as OBAF type star systems, those seem to pick up a lot of nice astronomical bodies in there. Also I use economic plotting, so more jumps.
</p>

<p>
After dozen or so jumps I realized economic route plotting is way too slow, carrier just speds off leaving me behind even without me scanning many special planets, so switched back to fastest route plotting.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T05:39:45Z I'm bored and hungry, going to shut down elite, no idea if its for good on today or will I continue after relaxing a bit.

</p>


	<h2>2021-03-31 New Day of Exploration</h2>

<p>
2021-03-31T15:51:06Z New Elite day has started, I think, just slept like 5hrs 30min so guess this is a new day heh. Back in PMC Explorer cockpit, lets plot the next carrier jump again.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T16:10:02Z Reached the next jump destination, switched to economic route plotting without filtering.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T16:56:25Z Docked at Ogaihs OU-N c20-17/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrival, sold exploration data and switched to PMC Trader for tritium refueling. Donated 32t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T17:18:14Z Docked at Ogaihs PX-X c28-34/Q1L-19Z. Donated 112t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T17:39:15Z Docked at Dryeae Froa WB-O c6-5/Q1L-19Z. Donated 110t of tritium to fuel depot.

<p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:26:15Z Docked at Ainaiwyg HZ-M d8-84/Q1L-19Z. Donated 111t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:39:47Z I was sitting in carrier management window waiting for timer countdown to a jump while NVIDIA driver crashed and made elite unusable, it was black screen. Elite was running on the background I could hear sounds etc. So I had to kill it from task manager.
</p>

<p>
As a remainder; NO other game does this for PMC Gaming computer, its just elite. No idea why, guess its the most GPU intensive program I run but still it baffles me how it does this across different nvidia driver versions. Edit: 2022-01-16T15:53:00Z, this is caused by faulty GPU, my Nvidia GTX TITAN X (2015 model) is breaking down or has always been broken hard to say. Nvidia drivers crash also constantly much more than in elite when I'm playing <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org" target="_blank">Farming Simulator 22</a> which is directx 12 win10 requiring game.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:46:40Z Elite restarted back up.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:46:30Z Docked at Dryua Priae VL-S b51-6/Q1L-19Z. Donated 111t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
I am really bored again, will switch to exploration mode after this current jump. We are 8 jumps (9 if you count current one) away from the destination and if you recall the destination is just general area, I might even end this part of the journey bit sooner or on some other interesting system nearby.
</p>

<p>
This journey will definitely have a definite end, it began with tritium loading to carrier and ends by carrier reaching the selected destination area. After that... I have no idea, no plan whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Only idea I have is that my hands are tied with tritium fuel, I will not never ever mine it to fly my carrier somewhere, it has to be bought from a station in 790t loads. Mining 100t of tritium takes roughly one hour, so its 7-8 hours to get full lakon type-9 load and nice even 10 hours for one carrier tritium depot full. This is so much grind that as said many times by now I will never ever do it again.
</p>

<p>
Obviously this reduces our carrier range a lot, we can reach galaxy core and back to the bubble with one full cargo hold of tritium, I have not calculated the actual location in galaxy map where you can do round trip without cargo refueling from station. Does colonia work as refuel point, I don't know, I've heard random chatter that its not a really good refueling location.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T19:08:14Z Docked at Hypoea Flyiae JX-A d1-62/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Filled PMC Wanderer tritium depot to full 1000t. Then switched to PMC Explorer, plotted next carrier jump and then went to explore.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T20:22:15Z arrived at Wembia KQ-G c13-5 system, this is on Outer Arm sector which is my first time here <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:11:37Z Found tritium overlapping hotspot, yellow on yellow at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1 4 ring.
</p>

<p>
This is quite decent find, so far out here in "north west" on galaxy plane, definitely worth to prospect what kind of percentages this gives.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-31 Arriving to Our Destination</h2>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:22:24Z arrived at Phae Flaae OO-Z d13-35 system. This is now the destination system of PMC Wanderer exploration journey (as said just general area or anchor if you will). PMC Wanderer is still two jumps away from here, this is discovered system with icy rings, but I'm going to try to find suitable system for PMC Wanderer to park, you know undiscovered etc.
</p>

<p>
Actually to think of it... why not that tritium overlapping hotspot system, I mean what better place to park especially as its only one jump away (roughly) from the initial destination anchor.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:31:20Z Decided to park PMC Wanderer next to tritium double overlapping hotspot, it just simply makes sense.
</p>

<p>
It was 406ly jump from current location and as said only another 600ly away from the original destination anchor point, it makes perfect sense to park it next to this tritium overlapping hotspot. Hell I couldn't have scripted this better, huge journey here and then I find such location right next to my destination heh, just awesome <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Cant wait to try out mining it, yes I know I know you buy tritium not mine it, but surely if you find awesome location its great for recreational tritium mining. At least it gives nice break from all the exploring.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:48:41Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer has arrived, docked and sold exploration data.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer tritium depot 241t and cargo tritium 16133t.
</p>

<p>
My plan is not to mine tritium in order to get more fuel for PMC Wanderer, but just to see how "profitable" that double overlapping hotspot is.
</p>

<p>
Switched to PMC Miner 3 which is sub-surface deposit and laser mining python.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:05:16Z Forgot to write down but couple of minutes ago dropped to the ring and started mining tritium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:17:06Z After mining few asteroids... I unfortunately have to say I'm not impressed. I found so far no sub-surface deposits worth to mine (found one) and general percentages have been max 15% but I found one 29% with material content high. So dunno.
</p>

<p>
And now... I'm starving, I have to take a lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:37:35Z Feeding time over, back to tritium mining.
</p>

<p>
Timings in this first run wont reflect reality like in how long will it take to get 100t mined etc. But we'll do another run unless this first one is really bad.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T23:58:50Z Cargo and refinery bins are full, heading back to the carrier.
</p>

	<h2>2021-04-01 First Mining Trip Aftermath</h2>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:01:40Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Was trying to donate tritium to fuel depot when I got transaction error heh. When I logged back on the 224t tritium donation did go through, however the 8 or some tons in refinery bins... are now stuck there, they wont get processed. I have to assume they process the next time I go to mining and vent one, collect it and then ... dunno, weird situation heh.
</p>

<p>
Once I took one tritium ton from carriers cargo into pythons cargo, then refinery processing activated and 8t of tritium appeared. I donated those to carriers tritium depot, 473t is the current status.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:09:07Z Decided to call it a night as while I'm not tired or even exhausted yet... I would sure be if I'd go do that second tritium mining test run.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:09:44Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 84 traveled distance: 4219.79Ly, stations visited: 10, special planets ammonia: 1, water: 3, planets smallest: 380.528km, largest: 77445.5km, detail surface scans: 537
</p>

<p>
Overall the first mining run was laser mining, only in the end I found few sub-surface deposit asteroids. If we subtract the lunch break time... this was like what, about 1h 40min of mining to get 224t + 8t python full of tritium?
</p>

<p>
Hmm, I'll do another uninterrupted run tomorrow for first 100t and then the python's full cargo, then we get to compare numbers.
</p>

<p>
Overall I must say... nothing's changed, you WILL buy tritium from stations, its unbearable grind to mine it, just don't do it man.
</p>

	<h2>2021-04-01 Second Mining Trip Conclusion</h2>

<p>
2021-04-01T15:26:04Z Elite back up, today we do that planned second tritium mining test, python full of minerals.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T15:32:43Z Dropped into the rings, first prospector drone fired.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:08:49Z Got 100t tritium in cargo.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:32:52Z One hour is up! Cargo now 176t.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:52:42Z Ran out of limpets, I had 150 which I considered a lot, guess not then.
</p>

<p>
On this test run I discarded all &lt;15% asteroids for laser mining and while I did use pulse wave analyzer to hunt down sub-surface deposits, I was mainly focusing on laser mining.
</p>

<p>
Current tritium status: 224t cargo hold and 1t in the refinery hopper, so got pretty close to full.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:57:24Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer unloaded cargo to tritium depot, aaand got black adder transaction error disconnect again same as yesterday hehe. So reconnected and took one ton from carriers cargo and put it back to make refinery bin spit out its contents, then put it to tritium depot.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer tritium depot now 698t.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T17:00:03Z Shut down Elite, need to cook food and decide what else I'm going to do today, unfortunately that most likely wont be playing elite... dunno just don't feel like continuing anymore today.
</p>

<p>
I actually logged back in and shut down carriers services, JUST in case I decided to take longer than week break...
</p>

<p>
The End.
