<p>
2018-11-15T11:17:30Z started elite up, back to trading.
</p>

<p>
Took me a while to get started (actually two damn hours by looking at it) as I was re-writing bunch of <a href="tradedangerous.php">tradedangerous</a> page heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T13:12:19Z arrived at Caspatsuria system in Binney Dock station.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T13:23:33Z arrived at CD-65 76 system in Alex's Rest station, completed trade route and broke 10 million credit barrier! Whohoo <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 10.260m cr. Still so far before I can upgrade my ship, but with good trade routes and steady pace... we'll get there, no worries.
</p>

<p>
Oh btw when I logged into elite and was sitting in a station writing that tradedangerous page, a CMDR send me a greeting which I did not see until much later. That bummed me out as I don't know how to send message to a CMDR from the cockpit comms menu, the history tab shows contacts but don't include chat/msg option and from the chat console I don't know how to send a message after local CMDR contact has disappeared. I hate when I send message to someone and they don't reply back, so I really do not want to be that guy who ignores everyone.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T13:40:39Z interdiction attempt by AI ship, managed to jump.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T13:56:58Z arrived at CD-65 76 system, Alex's Rest station and got budget 11.066m cr.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T15:04:14Z arrived at Paul-Friedrichs Star system budget now 12.042m cr.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T16:10:36Z at Banapityas system in Marshburn Dock station saw three other CMDR's, tried to local chat, no reply.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T16:33:31Z at marshburn dock again three CMDR's beside me, nobody replied when I asked if anyone is interested in trade wing.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T16:50:13Z got interdicted by wanted imperial courier AI ship, he demanded pretty little of cargo but I wouldnt give even the little. Nice high wake out of there and trading continues.
</p>

<p>
Been thinking a lot about my march 2018 experiences on trading which were with my real CMDR account "Snake Man" which is <a href="cmdr-snake-man-my-path-to-a-triple-elite.php">triple elite</a> ranked, using shieldless lakon type-9. Thinking that maybe there is some lame game mechanic that harmless newbie sidewinder pilots will not get interdicted by AI almost never where pro trader with combat rank of elite in huge trading ship does get, so much so that its killing all the fun in trading. I don't know, just thinking various possibilities because the trading experience was so much different back in march.
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking that... I want to test this out and bring my real CMDR account back to jameson memorial who is 3300ly out there exploring, grab my good old lakon type-9 and go trading. If I would immediately got "griefed" by AI interdictions then it would be clear that there are double standard regarding interdictions between different combat or trading ranks, which makes no sense at all.
</p>

<p>
I took a mission to bring basic medicines to marshburn dock station where I was going anyways and to bring basic medicines. Now this is a little bit fishy thing as whole purpose of this CMDR save clear is to trade traditionally, not do bounty hunting, not accept the 10k cr charity etc, so by doing missions... I'm not... well exactly trading. I mean mission to buy and bring goods into another station... that is trading, heh, cooky? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T17:37:16Z at marshburn dock station I delivered the 66t of basic medicines for this mission, I chose reward of 501,873cr. Hey everything counts now to purchase that next trading ship and doing delivery missions is a one form of trading hehe.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T17:46:55Z got interdicted by AI ship, demanded like 22k cr worth of cargo before I high waked outta there.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T18:30:57Z had a chat with CMDR Dargon212 about trading, he was flying type-7. he sent a friend request and I accepted.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T18:50:38Z was on mission to bring some basic medicines, got interdicted and cops showed up and helped. I was just charging my FSD on high wake jump out when the cops showed so I stayed and enjoyed them killing that bastard pirate <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Delivered 9t of basic medicines to potter hub, chose reward of 101,899cr. Almost not worth my time to detour from my usual route, but oh well.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T19:03:40Z budget now 18.232m cr. really close now for a ship upgrade.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T19:31:35Z budget now 19.009m cr.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T19:44:30Z was interdicted again in dountidi system, decided to once see the piracy game mechanic so I stopped and listened the pirates demands, it was mere 3t of cargo so I jettisoned 3x silver. He already got off few shots at me, no damage as had shields on, but this time no cops showed up even though I was waiting to see if they arrive while this guy is picking up the cargo. The cargo scooping was super fast, I barely got my ship turned around and he had already scooped the 3 cannisters, wow is he fast or what.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T20:06:52Z arrived at Dountidi system and budget now 19.749m cr.
</p>

<p>
And I think the outbreak or something finished because suddenly the basic medicines did not get much profit at all and for the return hop I bring in palladium so now suddenly there was 633t available instead of the usual 4t.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T20:35:53Z alright I have enough credits and because I'd also have to move to better market areas, I'm off to upgrade the ship now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T20:58:22Z purchased lakon type-7, traded in the old type-6. Name: PMC Trader 4, ID: PMC005. budget now 2.186m cr. <a href="https://s.orbis.zone/yni" target="_blank">coriolis.io</a>
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T21:35:39Z arrived at Sosong system in Soddy Gateway station, sold my first haul in type-7 for 279,000cr.
</p>

<p>
2018-11-15T22:08:33Z arrived at Chih Zhua system, sold my cargo and had about 3 million credits. Decided to end playing here, at least for now.
</p>

<p>
The goal was to start from scratch and trade only until I get to lakon type-9, well this type-7 was much more short term goal for a while and I started to think about what I said earlier to try out trading with my real account. So that is what I'm going to do now, switch elite to my real account, fly PMC Explorer back to populated space and break out PMC Trader, the good old lakon type-9 workhorse <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
So I went from starter sidewinder and 1000cr into Lakon Type-7 with about 3 million credits in 2 days and 8 hours (didn't really count or push how many hours I slept). In short "from sidewinder to type-7 in 2.5 days" I guess.
