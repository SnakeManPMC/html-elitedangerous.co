	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
2021-03-29 Today was odyssey alpha release date. It has nothing to offer for me as the exploration with all systems and old commander snapshot comes at phase 4 which is not even announced yet, today they start to test that stupid first person shooter combat/missions shit.
</p>

<p>
I decided to start loading PMC Wanderer (Q1L-19Z fleet carrier) with tritium and depart to a long exploration journey.

	<h2>2021-03-29 Hauling Tritium</h2>

<p>
2021-03-29T13:24:19Z Booted Elite back up, boarded my PMC Explorer (ASP Explorer), jumped to Pongo/AntonelliCity and then ordered PMC Wanderer to jump there.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-29T13:49:05Z Docked at Pongo/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrived to the system and docked PMC Explorer there. Now need to add tritium buy order and start to haul it myself.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer has now 15t LTDs and 844t tritium in cargo hold, tritium depot 908t. Donated tritium using PMC Trader lakon type-9 and now depot is full and cargo hold 752t.
</p>

<p>
Created tritium buy order of 19385 tons for 103,172 credits per ton. This is 200% of average market price. Then set LTD sell order for 129,288 credits per ton.
</p>

<p>
System chat buy order announcement: PMC Wanderer buying tritium 103k/ton with 19.3k demand. Selling 15t LTDs for 129.2k/ton. Body: Pongo 5.
</p>

<p>
Apparently that didn't work it left out "PMC" from the beginning heh, oh well. I then headed towards antonelli city to buy some tritium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-29T14:07:36Z Docked at Pongo/Antonelli City. Was purchasing tritium... except I forgot my wallet to the carrier <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Meaning my personal account only had 7 million in cash so I could only buy 149t tritium heh. Gotta grab some cash from the carrier. Then purchased full 790t cargo hold of tritium and headed back to PMC Wanderer.
</p>

Someone else had sold few tons as the demand was lower upon docking that what it was when I left last time. Nice. System chat is completely dead there is no CMDRs chatting, so must be someone shy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
And now I have to take a break, too much looping it gets boring. Dunno how long will this break last.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-29 Exploration Journey</h2>

<p>
Now I'm going to set course to somewhere "north west" of galaxy coordinates, somewhere along the line of 30k ly / 20k ly I think one of them were negative value I believe the -30k ly.
</p>

<p>
Initially I planned to take PMC Explorer and lead the way, but now it somehow ended up that PMC Trader has quite plenty of tritium cargo so why not use it live as we jump the carrier.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/14177949/name/Phae+Flaae+OO-Z+d13-35" target="_blank">Phae Flaae OO-Z d13-35</a> this is the system name I chosen for anchor point on spansh carrier route planner, I have no intentions to go for this system specifically but just the area that far away, then explore undiscovered virgin systems like I always do.
</p>

<p>
Spansh fleet carrier route planner calculates 78 jumps, estimated time a day, distance jumped 38.3k ly and used tritium fuel 9268t.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier/results/19CB0714-90C8-11EB-A71E-90A194EB4526?destination=Phae%20Flaae%20OO-Z%20d13-35&source=Pongo&tritium_fuel=1000&tritium_market=23950&used_capacity=25000" target="_blank">Spansh carrier route</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lets go <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I kind of regret already to take PMC Trader lakon type-9 with that much tritium in it, one jump is 132t and starts to drop after the first one as carrier weight gets lower. So hmm it will be like 6 jumps, each 20 minutes so yeah I might fall a sleep tonight before I get PMC Trader empty and can switch to PMC Explorer so I could actually do some exploring instead of sitting in the carrier hangar staring a timeout countdowns...
</p>

<p>
Oh well lesson learned for the next trip; do not buy any extra tritium fuel to your refueler tank ship it just doesn't benefit your trip at all.
</p>

<p>
So plan is now to jump as long as I can stay awake or get to switch ships. Below I'll list the time and systems PMC Wanderer jumped.

<p>
Then was my first chance to refuel fuel depot from PMC Trader's cargo hold, put in 50t of tritium just enough for next 500ly jump.

<p>
2021-03-29T22:36:19Z Docked at Bleae Thaa BD-V b57-7/Q1L-19Z.

</p>

<p>
Donated 130t tritium for another jump. Now PMC Trader cargo hold has only 98t of tritium left, on next jump it needs to tap into carriers cargo hold. After that I could dump whole 1000t into tritium depot and then take out PMC Explorer asp and go explore.
</p>

<p>
But dunno, I'm kind of relaxed now and just like to chill watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bwana" target="_blank">Bwana twitch live stream</a> about odyssey alpha.

<p>

</p>

<p>
Donated remaining 98t tritium to fuel depot, then refilled it to full using PMC Trader. Then switched to PMC Explorer, even though I want to chill... I want to explore just a little bit ahead of PMC Wanderer.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T00:40:59Z Traveled one fleet carrier 500ly hop using PMC Explorer asp, found few water worlds and scanned few rings, that took quite a while surprisingly heh.
</p>

<p>
Then sent PMC Wanderer on its way and I remain in PMC Explorer to follow, lets see if I can reach there first <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T01:07:36Z Docked at Blau Euq QR-N d6-54/Q1L-19Z. Stopped by at PMC Wanderer to sell exploration data and send her on her way to the next waypoint. I followed on PMC Explorer.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T02:32:55Z Found earth like and water world in Byaa Eurk GI-B d13-73 system, I was way ahead of PMC Wanderer now so decided to stop here and wait, well I mean continue to next waypoint and wait. Rest of the evening will be just absolute chill watching Bwana's odyssey alpha twitch live stream.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T03:02:27Z Ordered PMC Wanderer to do another jump... but then it was so late for me that I was yawning like crazy, its time to call it a night. Tomorrow will continue for sure.
