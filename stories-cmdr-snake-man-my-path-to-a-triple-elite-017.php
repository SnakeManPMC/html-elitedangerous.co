<p>2015-10-19T13:43:35Z: arrived to Shinrarta Dezhra, time to pick up my combat outfitted python and start to do combat.</p>

<p>Started combat rank progression. Balance 723,230,942 credits, combat rank Competent 10% status.</p>

<p>2015-10-20: reached Expert rank (didn't note the time, sorry).</p>

<p>2015-10-21: End of the day was Expert 46% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-22: End of the day was Expert 70% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-23: End of the day was Expert 87% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-24T22:13:36Z: reached combat rank of Master! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-10-25T09:08:24Z: End of the day was Master 10% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-26T09:30:11Z: End of the day was Master 20% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-27T08:16:46Z: End of the day was Master 38% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-28T03:11:36Z: Took out my combat Anaconda, its the only thing it rules over other ships (anaconda is not the best explorer, its not the best trader. However its good combat ship because of massive shields etc). Initially my plan was to outfit it with top of the line stuff including the 370 million armor however I could not wait to save the missing 55 million for it by doing Hazardous RES combat so I sold the armor and replaced with stock default one. Finished the outfitting otherwise (bought 7A shields and shield cell banks) and went for the first combat trials.</p>

<p>Anaconda was just good in combat, not great. In conflict zone it was very useful as it was shielded good and had turrets to shoot in all directions. For combat rank progression anaconda is great in conflict zones.</p>

<p>2015-10-28T07:59:46Z: End of the day was Master 61% rank.</p>

<p>2015-10-29T11:19:44Z: Reached combat rank of Dangerous!</p>

<p>2015-10-29T11:43:59Z: End of the day was Dangerous 1% rank.</p>

<p>Conclict Zones are clearly the most useful on progressing combat rank. In Hazaroud Resource Extraction Sites you get so low amount of ships and there is a lot of waiting time, while in conflict zone you get mayhem shoot'em up constantly.</p>

<p>2015-10-30T10:34:43Z: End of the day was Dangerous 5% rank.</p>
