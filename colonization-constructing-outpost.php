	<h2>Colonizing Constructing Outpost</h2>

<p>
Outpost is the smallest primary slot/port you can build, its either outpost or big star port which would be crazy big work load.
</p>

<p>
Outpost required commodities are total of 21,600 tons give or take hundred as its randomly fluctuating number when beginning construction.
</p>

<p>
Using Lakon Type-9 Heavy cargo trading ship, this 21.6k tons is 27.3 so basically 28 cargo hauling trips with  with its 790t cargo capacity.
</p>

<p>
If you are not ready for 28 cargo hauling round trips, then colonization is not for you.
</p>

<p>
Why you should build orbital outpost station as primary port? It is the smallest amount of construction raw materials, required commodities, you need to cargo haul to system colonization ship, if you choose a huge starport like coriolis, ocellus or orbis, those require just absolutely insane amount of cargo, I don't have the actual numbers at hand but I recall ocellus/orbis being something like 240,000 tons of cargo, that is 240000/790 == 303.79 so basically 304 cargo runs you need to do in Lakon Type-9 Heavy. I can honestly say it will be pure torture if you need to do that much cargo hauling in four weeks (28 days) time. If you feel like you're up to it, maybe you have bunch of friends in your squadron or something, then great, go for it, but please remember that if you are a lone CMDR doing all this cargo running by yourself... well as said, it is pure torture for sure, I've heard many stories where a lone CMDR's could not do it in time remaining (28 days, ie four weeks).
