	<h2>Fleet Carrier Buy Location Elite Dangerous</h2>

<p>
When fleet carrier owner chooses a station/outpost or planetary surface port to buy commodities from so that he creates buy order in the carrier and then cargo hauling traders fulfill that order getting some nice profits, it is very important that the planet is chosen so its easily accessible.
</p>

<p>
For example very high gravity on a planet where traders are supposed to land many times over during the course of this buy order "mission" is really a poor choice. I would say that gravity of 1 or above are immediate rejection for a location, honestly I would go as low as maybe 0.85G or so, you need some serious piloting skills to land on a high gravity planet, even if its in the .85G to 1 or slighly above.

Also be aware of parking by the primary star, see <a href="">fleet carrier parking by the primary star</a> page for details. PMCTODO this linked page is yet to be created 2025-06-06T09:06:58Z

<p>
Some cargo haulers, quite a lot of them actually, don't like planetary landings, guess they consider it taking too long time or is simply too difficult I'm not sure what exactly, but you often hear grinding of teeth when cargo hauler sees fleet carrier buying commodities like CMM composite which requires planetary landing. Note that you can buy ceramic composites and CMM composite from trailblazer megaships but obviously those have their own set of problems then. In my personal opinion trailblazer megaship system is much MUCH worse than any below 1G gravity planetary landing.
