	<h1>Second CMDR Clear Save Mining Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
This is the famous 2020 Low Temperature Diamond (LTD) era mining frenzy space exploration story about CMDR Snake Man (me) mining LTDs for billions of credits.

	<h2>2020-07-08 Purchasing Few Ships</h2>

<p>
2020-07-08T10:07:21Z New Elite day has started. I am really not looking forward to another day of LTD mining with SLF exploit, as LTD market prices are still 1.1 million.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that maybe I would start this day by going to buy all the necessary PMC Wanderer ships for the eventual exploration journey.
</p>

<p>
In discord Cometborne let us know that khronos/evans hub is on the four correct states for the possibility of having good LTD prices but nobody had EDDN send from there, so I took PMC Explorer and quickly zipped there to scan it and walter refinery station as well.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T10:35:39Z Docked at Khronos/Evans Hub.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T10:44:50Z Docked at Khronos/Walter Refinery.
</p>

<p>
Its medium pad station with only 96t demand with 1.4 million per ton price, no good with that combination.
</p>

<p>
Came back to PMC Wanderer and really did not feel like continuing mining LTDs, I'd like to do something else, something more interesting.
</p>

<p>
Been thinking about exploration dry run to see how my ship selection works in real life situations. Like hopping maybe 1000ly from the bubble and conduct exploration, canyon NOP flying, SRV driving and mining with laser, sub-surface and core cracking ships. All this to simulate a real 50k ly out there deep in the black situations. If I find some ship is lacking outfitting etc, its easy to come back to fix, to tweak the ship/outfitting selections.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T12:31:09Z Dropped to col 285 LTD3 rings, lets mine one load.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T14:49:06Z Cargo hold is full 704t, refinery bins are full 10t, we are RTB.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T14:57:37Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. Alright this time I won't be dumping the LTD load into carriers cargo hold as I want to sell it directly to get some credits which I use to buy rest of the ships we need for full compliment. Now... where do we sell, the prices are still very very low, hmm.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer now has 2127t tritium in cargo and 346t in the tank. Just trying to calculate route if I need to jump to selling point, near shinrarta dezhra and then to "explore" and back, do I have enough gas.
</p>

<p>
Decided to go sell to the chicken coop carrier in Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-2 system which pays 1.158 million per ton, still better price than the highest paying station. Now we only wonder if the carrier works...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T15:25:00Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-2/KNF-L0Q. Attempted to sell... and this carrier naturally had the sell bug, sigh. Checked out two other carriers, they were dud's as well, sigh.
</p>

<p>
Plotted jump to San Qin Gu system, stations there are buying for 1.1 million per ton, bad prices but what can you do I cannot wait any longer, I want to DO something (other than mining).
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T16:16:57Z Docked at San Qin Gu/Sinclair Colony. Sold 704t of LTDs for 804.6 million, then refinery processed 8t more and sold those for 9.1 million, credits now 814.5 million.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T16:50:16Z Docked at Shinrarta Dezhra/Jameson Memorial. Now begins ship purchasing frenzy, I need to buy several ships and equip them properly.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T18:05:17Z Finished purchasing new ships (sorry don't have a list to show).
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T18:11:06Z Docked at Eravarenth/Q1L-19Z. Back at PMC Wanderer where I set my ships to transfer into the carrier. ETA roughly 6mins, just next door to Jameson Memorial.
</p>

<p>
Ships arrived and then I plotted route towards Corona Austr. Dark Region OX-U b2-3 which is the second LTD triple overlap system. Oddly enough from Shinrarta Dezhra it is two jumps, annoyingly the second jump would be mere 16.7ly so I'm definitely just going to park PMC Wanderer just there and fly my ships rest of the way.
</p>

<p>
Type-9 might have to do two jumps but its fine.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T18:43:37Z Docked at Swoilz IY-Y d1-57/Q1L-19Z. Just 16.72ly away from the LTD triple overlapping hotspot system. Lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
First I want to test PMC Scout Prospector, to simulate it leading the way scouting nearby areas trying to find tritium when PMC Wanderer is out of fuel <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well PMC Scout Prospector first test shows that it has pitiful 4t cargo capacity which is meant for prospector limpets, well 4 is not much... you wont be doing much prospecting with that heh. So hmm maybe I need to let go of the guardian FSD booster or something, I don't know?
</p>

<p>
Then Elite servers started to act up, could not get into super cruise after several attempts, so I decided to take a lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T20:49:36Z Lunch break is over, lets see if we can get in-game.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-08 My First Deep Core</h2>

<p>
2020-07-08T21:51:09Z My first ever deep core mining trip is done. I have to say yeah it was cool to blow up the asteroid, but it almost felt like after that nice explosion... you get absolutely nothing worth your time from the pitiful abrasion blaster shootings as one deposit gives one fragment.
</p>

<p>
When you compare deep core to sub-surface mining, oh my you cant compare them they are nothing alike. One sub-surface deposit drill missile hit ejects like 3-7 fragments and you can get several of these from this deposit, it is just not comparable to deep core at all.
</p>

<p>
Also finding the deep core asteroids is very difficult, you can fly around for ages not seeing any. While like laser mining you find some percentage of content on every other asteroid, at least.
</p>

<p>
Deep core looks great, but thats all it is, make little kids go "oooh aaah!" and clap their little hands.
</p>

<p>
Most likely this was my first and last deep core mining session, I just see no reason doing it again.
</p>

<p>
Anyways I got 56t of LTDs out of this deep core trip, PMC Wanderer now has 11,229t of LTDs and 1745t of tritium.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T23:22:17Z Tested PMC Cobra with SRV, drove like 45min on planets surface trying not to get motion sickness. Then took PMC NOP (nap of the planet) eagle and went to the smallest body in this system, well the un-engineered eagle speed which is 266m/s is just awfully slow, it felt like driving miss daisy heh.
</p>

<p>
I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with PMC NOP, I expected stock eagle to be much better I mean this is not much difference to PMC Explorer which is stripped down gas can basically heh. If I really want a cool nap of the planet flyer I need to engineer the thrusters in this eagle, unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-08T23:27:40Z Time to end playing for today, getting a bit tired and don't have anything specific to do now as I'm sure wont be starting a regular mining session. Tomorrow I'll most likely return to the bubble or perhaps visit the fourth LTD 3 system, dunno.
