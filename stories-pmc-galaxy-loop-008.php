<p>2016-09-05T18:08:45Z arrived to Pro Eurk KX-L d7-16, then decided to land on a planet, didn't check its gravity which was 1.3G, not too bad but definitely something to be careful with. I listened to twitch elite stream on the background and on top of that started to take screenshots in external view when approaching planet from 35KM altitude (glide failed due to high angle).
</p>

<p>Well you see where this is going... hehe, yes indeed CMDR <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I leveled my ship still several kilometers above the planet surface, but it was too late, my ASP kept on sinking like a rock and BOOM! I got destroyed on the surface of this ringed planed. Fucking hell! whos the newbie now? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I'm actually not angry, I've been here too many times to know better, there is nobody else to blame but me... if you don't learn, you die. Simple.
</p>

<p>But needless to say, I'll probably take "a few" days off from exploration now as this PMC Galaxy Loop starts to become bit too sad story hehe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>So decided to head back out, actually I was eager to beat my EliteLog v1.0.4 record of 567 jumps in one session (basically in a day). So I looked my notes about found ammonia / earth like / water worlds before I crashed (which data were lost) and plotted bookmarked course for them.
</p>

<p>I also decided that PMC exploration doctrine now is to <b>NOT LAND ON ANY PLANETS</b> until I have practised landing in Elite v2.2 beta like fucking hundred times! I've had enough of these screwups in this journey, now we do things right.
