<p>
2020-07-13T08:29:00Z New Elite day has started, two days before fleet carriers patch 3 which most likely will fix mining exploits and ruin all the credit making fun.
</p>

<p>
PMC DevSurf: 2020-07-13T0829 launched second account, PMC PapaBear is orbiting Jamanu 1 and LTDs for 1.548 million/ton have been sold out. Awesome. Asked in system chat if anyone needs a ride, nobody did so I plotted a jump to col 285 LTD 3 rings again, lets get back to mining.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear credits balance 7.362 billion, oh nice. Once jump was completed I created LTD buy order for 4288t at usual 1.448 million per ton price.
</p>

<p>
Also installed EDMC v4.0 elease candidate to PMC DevSurf and updated PMC PapaBear with it. Now, why didn't I think of this before? So simple matter to just install EDMC on PMC DevSurf which solves all wonderings about if EDDB/inara etc is up to date on our demand/supply <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T09:33:24Z Todays gaming session already started above but now I launched PMC Gaming real account and updated with EDMC. Checked eddb/inara... and PMC Wanderer was sold out and PMC PapaBear was selling out super fast, half of the demand was already met (4011 to 2075), was wondering wow that was fast... until I realized from inara best selling station page... that LTD market prices had crashed and PMC carriers were among the top-10 highest paying carriers in the galaxy <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I mean PMC carriers pay now more for LTDs than ANY station, of course all miners jump to a chance to cash in. Yes we are paying insane amount, but prices will go up again so then we continue our business.
</p>

<p>
After writing this text... PMC PapaBear had sold out, all fucking 4011t haha! That is crazy beyond belief! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T09:48:07Z PMC Wanderer created new buy order for 538t at 1,000,553 credits.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T09:59:06Z PMC PapaBear created new buy order for 355t at 1,000,553 credits.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer cargo hold got 21,716t of LTDs and 882t tritium. And after writing this & refreshing the page its 21,723t LTDs now heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T10:15:09Z Arrived to LTD 3 rings, started mining few minutes later (had few real life chores to do quickly). I'm with The Egg, with SLF exploit on PMC Miner 2. Lets milk this cow dry until patch 3 makes it all go away on wednesday, two days from now.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T12:28:05Z Was dead tired and needed to take a nap so had to cut mining trip short, LTDs in cargo 532t, going to fly off the ring a bit and then just shut down Elite.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T15:40:56Z Woke up from nap, PMC Gaming was on, I see a new 1.731 million buying station, Nivati/Chamitoff Enterprise with 2604t demand.
</p>

<p>
Saw discord broken limpet advertisement for buying LTDs 1.5 million so decided to go sell my half full load there (ok 532t is pretty full).
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T15:51:03Z Docked at HIP 104182/QLF-L8G. Carrier name was hard to spell heh, sold 532t LTDs for 798.2 million credits. Sure I could have stored these and sold for the highest paying station at 1.731 million, but this was pretty good deal for half full load.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T15:56:57Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer dumped that LTD sell money to carriers balance then created 794t (heh max no sell bug deduction value as well) LTD buy order for 1 million. Okay its old price, but yeah.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer cargo now 22,254t of LTDs oh wow.
</p>

<p>
Nivati/Chamitoff Enterprise with 2604t demand so with bulk tax avoidance it comes to 651t per load. Yeah I'm going to move PMC Wanderer there for sell this monster load of diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T16:08:16Z Plotted jumps for both PMC carriers, Wanderer got straight at the selling station body but PapaBear had to jump blind and will need a in-system jump to get closer. Alright soon we will be swimming with credits, our first 1.7+ million sell <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Chamitoff Enterprise buys at 1,731,578 credits so I created PMC carriers sell order at 1,631,553 credits, traders will get 100k per ton profits. Wanderer 22,254t and PapaBear 4288t.
</p>

<p>
Plotted jump for PMC PapaBear to Nivati A 1 as well, now we are in business <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T16:33:07Z First announce in system chat, here we go, lets sell! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T16:59:19Z Finished lunch, now I'll start to haul 651t of LTDs to sale per trip, aayeah credits gimme some.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T17:50:57Z PMC Wanderer supply left 3929t oh wow that is amazing rate of unloading. Cant tell what PMC PapaBear is but EDDB shows 3680t 39mins ago.
</p>

<p>
THIS is the bulk trading I'm liking even though there still was one miserable bitter little cunt of a CMDR who commented that 100k is not enough profit for traders that they deserve more, I don't care about his miserable comments I am having time of my life as diamonds are flying off the cargo racks <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh and I'm also making huge profit by trading this stuff myself, have done hmm three loads now, CMDR Snake Man PMC just joined me in multi-crew and got 3.6 million trade dividend (too bad its so low).
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T18:08:29Z PMC Wanderer LTD sell order SOLD OUT. Haha awesome! Heading over to PMC PapaBear to check its status.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T18:20:30Z PMC PapaBear LTD sell order SOLD OUT. This is crazy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fleet carriers patch 3 patch notes were published</b>, they will reduce the effectiveness of overlapping hotspots and they fixed the SLF exploit, hopefully it works this time.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer credit balance 40 billion! ;-)
</p>

<p>
Created LTD buy orders for PMC carriers maxed out at 1.431 million per ton. Yes this is slightly lower than before but I'm using my new 200k profit formula. PMC Wanderer got maxed out 23,752t buy order!
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear credit balance 8.158 billion, created LTD buy order for 4904t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T19:04:35Z All the carrier logistic work was done, now its time to go The Egg SLF exploit mining and advertising PMC carriers. Wonder if we get flak from CMDR's in system chat who notice our prices dropped like 17k or something, heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T19:32:26Z Started to mine 5min ago or so.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T23:10:29Z Lunch break is over, also I started to create fc.php as The Egg did not respawn and I was just sitting there waiting while advertising PMC carriers in system chat.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-14</h2>

<p>
2020-07-14T01:00:05Z PMC PapaBear got full, plotted jump to nivati a 1, docked at PMC Wanderer, rearmed and started mining. Yes all in this timestamp, honest.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear created LTD sell order for 4904t at 1.631 million per ton. Updated EDDN and hoped people will pick the prices up as I'm mining on PMC Gaming computer heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T01:08:35Z Started mining, pirates were gone, I was by The Egg, lets do this.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T01:49:32Z PMC PapaBear supply down to 4712t (from 4904t) which is very very slow progress, last night with the exact same prices we had this amount of cargo completely unloaded already. I think the locally advertising really means something. This time I am not going to advertise, it will be a nice test how much eddb/inara can do alone. Maybe some CMDR's are just in the system chat and don't even know what 3rd party sites are, who knows.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T02:10:34Z PMC PapaBear supply down to 3880t, really slow going compared to yesterday...
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear sold out. Credit balance 9.138 billion <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T03:34:50Z Finished mining, PMC Miner 2 is full.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T03:37:27Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. Sold 704t + 8t of LTDs, PMC Wanderer demand down to 13,764t. Hmm I am somewhat surprised how slowly miners are selling to PMC carriers now, ok its about ten thousand sold now so, dunno yeah.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm going to PMC PapaBear service outfit some mining stuff. I'm somewhat unsure if that business will work, but gotta try it for the experience, also its second account so who cares right.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T03:56:46Z Finished purchasing outfitting packs for PMC PapaBear, quite interesting setup. I was pretty tired too heh, almost skimmed through them and then sent her back to col 285 LTD 3 rings. I noticed that the cargo capacity was reduced greatly, dunno how good trading ship it will be, maybe I'll do most trading in PMC Wanderer dunno.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T04:02:13Z In PMC Wanderer switched to PMC Miner 3 (python sub-surface) and headed out to mining/advertising. I just wanted some change and relaxed python flying for the end of the evening here.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T04:10:31Z Started mining, pirates were hovering over me, waiting a bit. PMC PapaBear looks like jumping back to col 285 mines as well. The Egg did not re-spawn, oh well lets go just random mining then.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear credit balance 7.471 billion after purchasing all those service outfitting module packs. Created LTD buy order for 4425t at 1.431 million per ton.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T06:30:04Z Dead tired cant concentrate mining anymore, gotta get some sleep, time to call it a night. Tomorrow last day of The Egg, we are going hardcore.
