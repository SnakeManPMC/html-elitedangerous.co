<p><b>120 Hop Mega Route</b></p>

<p>2015-10-01T02:55:25Z: docked at Marrallang/Alfven Hub after picking up my Lakon Type-9 trade ship from Urvane, its time for some trading again! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>I updated TradeDangerous and calculated 120 hop mega trade route, its time to see how well such huge ordeal goes. I'm estimating that this will take three to four days depending on how much I get to play each day.
<br><br>
My current stats are total of 111,848,238 credits with trading profit of 538,825,578 credits. This current 120 hop route by TradeDangerous is estimated to bring in 107 million.
<br><br>
My trade rank is Tycoon with 24 percentage.</p>

<p>2015-10-01T04:29:39Z: at ICZ FW-V b2-7 system was interdicted by mostly mostly harmless anaconda, I thought that maybe my 5x beam lasers can take him... but I was wrong. Oh well, there went insurance money plus 532x palladium load of 7 million credits, easy come easy go hehe! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-10-01T08:52:45Z: was interdicted by a Python, I was timing how long it takes to jump 4 times so didn't even plan on fighting and started to boost and escape by engaging FSD. Well for some really odd reason I couldn't make it and was destroyed... damn, what kind of fucking super AI ships are there flying tonight? Killed twice in few hours now? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-10-03T23:29:07Z: docked and sold my last load of cargo! 120 hop mega trade route has been completed! Yeah baby yeah!</p>

<p>At end of 120 hop mega route my stats are total of 185,524,357 credits with trading profit of 630,560,380 credits. So I made 91,734,802 credits with this route. Trade rank vent up to 38%. <i>Note: but what about the insurance ship rebuy and the palladium load costs? Are those deducted from your current balance? Hmm.</i></p>
