<p>2016-08-18T16:44:49Z at Pru Eurk LX-L d7-105 back in the cockpit and departing towards New Yembo, AGAIN. Hehe crazy shit man, crazy ass shit.
</p>

<p>Only 3214Ly, one way...
</p>

<p>2016-08-18T19:15:38Z reached New Yembo, repaired ship and went back out...
</p>

<p>2016-08-19T20:59:07Z reached back to Pru Eurk LX-L d7-105. Hopefully now this stupid damaging my ship shit is DONE.
</p>

<p>Last discovered by CMDR name I saw was in: Pru Eurk YU-X c14-18 (3501Ly from Sol). Roughly (very roughly) after that point the CMDR discovered names were rare. So a good tip at August 2016 galaxy exploration state is to move 3500Ly away from the bubble before starting to explore, to avoid running into discovered by CMDR names all the time.
