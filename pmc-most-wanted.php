<p><b>Cmdr John Charger</b> - 2015-04-26T23:24:05Z, Synteini: I was with wing in Majkl who was interdicted in his Lakon Type-9, player killer was in python. I dropped into the same interdiction as I was following Majkl's lead. Player killer destroyed me first very very quickly. Afterwards I heard Majkl managed to get into super cruise, but was interdicted again so he combat logged after seeing what happened to me.</p>
