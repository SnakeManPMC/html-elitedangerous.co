<p>2015-04-25T00:37:37Z: decided to just go fly around in populated space in my Python, do some combat, maybe explore those stations with missing landing pad and distance to star info, etc. I just cannot continue exploring right now after that massive two week set.</p>

<p>Did couple of days just chilling with exploring stations on populated space, doing some RES and nav beacon combat. I didnt explore for profit, but still got little bit credits.</p>
