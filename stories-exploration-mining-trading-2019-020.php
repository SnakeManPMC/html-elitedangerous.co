	<h2>2019-09-27 Voyage Home</h2>

<p>
2019-09-27T03:55:19Z back in elite, voyage home continues...
</p>

<p>
Continuing towards the same waypoint as yesterday, I could have plotted longer route but just using the same waypoint. Got 229 jumps to go there. I'm now in the fast travel mode that I only stop to FSS scan ammonia/earth-like/water worlds.
</p>

<p>
Todays plan is to return to jameson memorial, Distance to Sol: 23,892.68 ly but doesn't really matter, I'll push on as long as I stay awake or get bored (you never know). I'm optimistic to get there today, in fact it might be piece of cake, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T04:14:15Z arrived at Syroifua MD-I c23-0 system which had a water world... discovered by a CMDR, in fact the whole system was discovered by TWO CMDRs. This is Distance to Sol: 23,295.58 ly which is quite unbelievable. I must be on some stupid expedition route or something because in galaxy of 400 billion star systems being this far out from sol... how is it humanly possible to run into so many systems discovered by other CMDRs.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T04:18:32Z arrived at Syroifua BL-P e5-0 system which star was discovered by Sam Ishum, however there was single body in this system, Syroifua BL-P e5-0 1 which was a water world, undiscovered. It was 13k LS away so maybe Sam had personal limit that he wont go after bodies beyond X number of LS, who knows. Obviously he was here before beyond exploration updates as he could have otherwise FSS discovered that water world. I did that and even supercruised there to surface mapping probing it.
</p>

<p>
But this is really troublesome, this system is Distance to Sol: 23,206.91 ly so yeah... I guess it needs to be 30k ly bubble around sol if you want to ensure the sunday explorers have not visited the area. Dunno man, I think 60ly jump range is now the norm so pretty much anybody can equip a good exploring Asp which reaches anywhere in the galaxy within days of dedicated exploring.
</p>

<p>
Exploring is not what it used to be.
</p>

<p>
This sucks.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T04:28:45Z arrived at Syroifua CW-E d11-0 system which system star was discovered by a CMDR, and the next system I jumped after that... haha, sigh <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T04:47:11Z decided to rise on the galaxy plane a bit maybe that would reduce the other CMDR stench. Well that didn't work, only 100ly up the plane and route plotter already failed heh, oh well back to the plane then. All I care about is getting back to populated space and to PMC EDDN Sender to go hunt missing station data.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T05:20:51Z arrived at Syroifaa WD-K d8-2 system discovered by a CMDR, water worlds... Then the next system was discovered by a CMDR as well, sigh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T06:24:14Z plotted route to jameson memorial, 19.4k ly away, 320 jumps. Here we go.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T08:35:29Z arrived at Byooe Thaa VP-G d10-31 system and was almost falling a sleep while playing, gotta take a couple of hour nap <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T08:36:02Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 193, special planets ammonia: 3, water: 16, planets smallest: 335.409km, largest: 71222.7km, detail surface scans: 700
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T11:12:37Z Nap is over, back in PMC Explorer cockpit and we continue. Still got 224 jumps to jameson memorial, 13.4k ly distance.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-27T14:40:26Z arrived at Prua Dryou XN-I c26-10 system which was mere 4700ly from sol and discovered by two CMDRs, so decided to stop checking FSS and just travel as fast as possible. I actually forgot to stop FSS scanning in the 10k ly mark heh.
