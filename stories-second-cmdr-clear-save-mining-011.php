<p>
2020-07-10T05:54:13Z New Elite day has started. Today starts by moving PMC carriers back to nearby of col 285 LTD 3 rings.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T05:59:11Z Plotted a jump to there for PMC Wanderer. Moments later with PMC PapaBear.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T06:19:26Z PMC Wanderer has arrived to Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3. Status tritium depot 870t and tritium in cargo 756t. CMDR Snake Man has 19.613 billion credits, darn didn't break twenty heh. PMC Wanderer had seven hundred some millions. Then I deposited all personal account money to carrier and now PMC Wanderer balance is 20.392 billion credits <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
LTD highest paying station currently is Areklici/heinlein dock with 1,648,986 credits. We should keep up with current trends so not too many CMDRs bad mouth us in system chat if we offer to buy with one million, so lets say 50k for the traders at the selling point, 250k profit for us, that would be 1,348,986 credits per ton.
</p>

<p>
I created LTD buy order for 14,327t paying 1,348,553 credits. This was done maxing out credits then deducting 794t which is the max cargo capacity of imperial cutter largest cargo ship in the game currently.
</p>

<p>
Pasted buy order announcement for broken limpets and fleet carriers owners club discord servers.
</p>

<p>
Switched to second account PMC PapaBear, its current balance is 5.106 billion, oh nice. My second account balance was like sevenhundred million something, deposited all the personal credits to carrier and now balance 5.583 billion.
</p>

<p>
I created second LTD buy order for PMC PapaBear, 3345t demand with 1.348 million per ton.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T06:51:56Z Aaaand finally switched back to real account where I'm hoping to stay at least until carriers are full of diamonds <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer now has 756t of tritium left in the cargo, its plenty for todays activities if it would happen that we need to go sell quickly, but need to keep an eye on the gas tank as refuel trip might happen somewhat soon.
</p>

<p>
Then I was off to mining again <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T07:03:42Z Started mining, well to wait until pirates leave. Here we are again, mining. On next tuesday the 15th FDEV releases fleet carriers patch 3 and I am positive they will fix all the mining exploits and who knows reduce LTD profitability once again, so I'm going to milk this thing all weekend no matter how burnt out I'd be. Now we go hardcore motherfucker.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T08:27:09Z Checked carrier management and seems 665t of LTDs have been sold there, nice start.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T09:34:55Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, CMDR's have sold 1720t of LTDs, wow very nice. I then offloaded my full cargo 704t plus 8t from refinery bins when it processed those. Carrier cargo now 2432t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T10:21:05Z Started mining few minutes ago, but for the first time 25km asteroid was depleted, no sub-surface deposits. Damn. Also in system chat "franzy" guy was bad mouthing PMC carriers, some ridiculous kiddie crap that we support antifa and we have sell bug, err what? Fucking idiots that have nothing better to do than to run their mouths. Was really difficult to not get caught by his "trolling" or whatever you can call it. Its really sad to see people struggle with mental health issues like franzy, hopefully he seeks help soon.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T10:44:43Z Small break here as I got note from mail slot that needed a phone call. Now we continue.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T12:11:44Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. Was wandering aimlessly and then got hungry, so decided to come to offload what I got now. And its not much, pitiful 96t of LTDs and 17t of tritium, damn without the 25km asteroid you really have slim pickings.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T12:16:46Z Jumped to a38-2 system, want to copy-paste PMC Wanderer buying LTDs adverts while I'm having a lunch, so lunch break ...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T12:41:32Z Lunch break over. Back to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T15:00:38Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer demand for LTDs was down to 7405t, thats close to 50% fulfilled now. I dumped my LTD load and now whole amount in carrier is 8442t. Getting to those crazy numbers again <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took an extended restroom break here to review previously merged video and then merged another one, so much video footage to go through heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T15:45:30Z Was ready to head out and when I checked demand for LTDs it was down to 6490t so carriers whole cargo 9357t. Goooood.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T16:00:58Z Started mining, pirates are gone, the 25km asteroid awaits!
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T18:14:37Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer buy order demand has gone down to 4503t, cargo hold total of 12,056t <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T18:45:42Z Lunch break over, back to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T18:49:29Z Started mining. The 25km asteroid did not re-spawn, had to go look for pitiful yields elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T20:51:20Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear demand was down to 2147t, nice.
</p>

</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer total LTD load now in cargo is 14,311t heh, hmm how much was it yesterday cant remember. But man when I sell this shizzle, its going to be so much credits ooh my.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-10T21:32:53Z Servers started to give yellow sidewinder errors when attempted to enter super cruise and it has been 16hrs day already so I decided to call it a night. Tomorrow we are going to sell some diamonds.
