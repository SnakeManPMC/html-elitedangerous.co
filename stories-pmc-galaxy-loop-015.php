	<h2>Long 11 Month Break Editing ArmA 3 Terrains</h2>

<p>2017-10-17 started v2.4 Horizons - The Return for the first time. This was me coming back to Elite since Nov 24th, 2016.
</p>

<p>I have now purchased Logitech X-56 Rhino HOTAS so I can finally play elite like its meant to be played. During this one year (almost) without elite I have lost all the skills of how to fly my ASP and I believe the new X-56 HOTAS also is with some default settings, or I just simply have zero muscle memory left as flying in elite was as unknown to any newbie.
</p>

<p>I practised in training mission navigation for like 5 times in a row to get hyper jumping with FSD into check. Okay I'm not a total dumbass, I do remember to cut throttle and not to collide with stars as after all I'm ranked Elite in exploration hehe, so basic exploration jumping should be fine. Only thing I need to learn again is fuel scooping, but I remember that being easy after you get used to it. Its crazy to think how much your skills are lost with "only" 11 month break...
</p>

<p>But still I was super scared of getting back into my ASP cockpit so far away from populated space and with so much exploration data. But what can you do, I don't have second account to train exploration or is there any real exploration suitable training missions so its time to jump head first into the deep end <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2017-10-17T04:44:37Z back in my ASP cockpit, finally!
</p>

<p>Took me a dozens of jumps before I started to get my muscle memory back, I thought it was totally gone but nah it was there. After couple of hours of flying it started to feel very natural again. Only thing that my brand new X-56 Rhino HOTAS throttle was damn stiff heh. Edit: it still is after almost two months of playing, I guess its by design then.
</p>

<p>2017-10-17T09:34:15Z finished for the first day back in Elite <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Managed to get muscle memory back and basic HOTAS control setup done. FSD jumped to 110 systems towards leg 08. Its all good, CMDR.
