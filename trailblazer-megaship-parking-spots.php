	<h2>Trailblazer Megaship Parking Spots</h2>

<p>
Trailblazer megaship systems are insanely popular by fleet carrier commanders, you are lucky if you get a parking spot for your carrier. On 2025-03-26T18:46:42Z it is highly recommended to straight up park your carrier to some nearby system and simply hyper space jump your cargo ship there and back, with super cruise traveling, its often the quickest way to get in and out (well definitely out heh, no brainer).
</p>

<p>
On 2025-04-09 I decided to give up on trailblazer megaship systems, there are so many problems with them, mainly being laggy, filled with fleet carriers, you cant get a fleet carrier parking spot on them, and previously megaship ran out of supply on some items but now it seems to be corrected at least on CMM composite, not sure about steel and titanium I've heard some comments that those are still often running low on supply. I am personally trying really hard to never go back to "mega" ship systems, they just are not worth it. Get your steel, titanium from whatever orbital starport, then grab ceramic composites and CMM composite from your favorite planetary landing surface port and the rest smaller items, basically from where ever you can scourge them up, nearby systems perhaps, it would be strange if everything is not available within hyper space jump or two in your cargo ship.

	<h2>Trailblazer Dream - HIP 90578</h2>

<p>
Col 285 Sector NV-I b24-1, distance 6.52LY, OK parking system.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector TK-E c12-23, distance 6.74LY, only main star at hyper space jump drop point, next star 3k LS away, next after that 97K LS, avoid this parking system if possible.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector XK-O d6-115, distance 9.38LY, several planets at the main star 30LS to 200LS distances, OK parking system.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector XK-O d6-89, distance 9.59LY, only non scoopable main star
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector XK-O d6-116, distance 8.43LY, only two stars
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector TK-E c12-33, distance 10.19LY, huge system, being colonized at the time of writing this.

	<h2>Trailblazer Promise - Klikis</h2>

<p>
2025-04-09T05:52:15Z Tried to get a fleet carrier destination in there, was a no go, "no free slots", so decided to travel there in PMC Explorer ASP and discovery scan the nearby systems to see if any of those would be nice to park your carrier into.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector NK-J b24-5 system, this is one of the nearby systems, first to reach for me. Only two stars and loaded with 16 fleet carriers on the main slot, this parking spot sucks.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector NK-J b24-4 system, distance 3.51LY, three stars only, primary slot loaded with 13 fleet carriers, planet 121LS away, had only one carrier orbiting, doesn't look like a nice place.
</p>

<p>
HIP 77617 system, distance 7.95LY, six fleet carriers at primary star, has several gas giants with planets/moons where there are bunch of empty parking spots, no idea how gravity well goes on those gas giants though. I guess this might be an OK system to park.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector NK-J b24-6 system, distance 7.55LY, multiple stars, couple of planets 12k LS away, 5 fleet carriers by the primary star, guess this could be used if there aren't more carriers than 5 in the primary star.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector SU-E c12-17 system, distance 5.60LY, single star: bad, only two fleet carriers: good.
</p>

<p>
HIP 77610 system, distance 7.98LY, several planets, only two fleet carriers, also has coriolis starport (didn't visit so don't know what they sell) and an outpost. This might be a good place to park.
</p>

<p>
Col 285 Sector LP-J b24-0 system, distance 6.39LY, two stars only, no fleet carriers. Well considering the distance and no fleet carriers, guess this might be the best place to park.

	<h2>Do Trailblazer Megaships Suck</h2>

<p>
Not exactly related, but I read in chat that trailblazer megaship in Klikis system is bad, <i>"Klikis for instance is worthless -- 116 of the 120 carrier parking spots are &gt;950 LS away, nobody will load unless I offer 50k/t"</i>. Personally I found trailblazer dream on the DAY ONE when they were deployed, worthless because civil war interdictions and the "mega" ship running out of stock on many goods.
</p>

<p>
Also <i>"Some of the other carrier systems have more sub-LS parking spots where people will load for me quickly. And even then, I only even try to park at the megaships to load large amounts of ground commodities like CMMs and Ceramic Composite -- otherwise, there's just better places to load a carrier."</i>
</p>

<p>
Yes, trailblazer "mega" ship systems suck, bad. Avoid them at all cost.
