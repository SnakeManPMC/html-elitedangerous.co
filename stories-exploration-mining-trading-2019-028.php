	<h2>2019-10-01 Mining Painite</h2>

<p>
2019-10-01T08:18:35Z New elite day has started, feeling pretty good after watching a lot of TV yesterday. Now plan is to do double hotspot painite mining.
</p>

<p>
Used <a href="http://edtools.ddns.net/miner" target="_blank">edtools.ddns.net/miner</a> website to check painite, I mean the mining spots don't change much (if at all?), decided go to HIP 73269 A1 ring A
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T08:38:47Z arrived at HIP 73269 system, started to fuel scoop tanks full.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T08:50:28Z arrived at A1 ring A. Lets start to mine... System authority vessel dropped in, so don't have to even wait for the mandatory pirate to disappear, nice.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T08:54:49Z First collector limpets brought in first piece of painite, alright we will be doing this for the next probably five to six hours heh.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T10:05:08Z Lunch break started...
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T10:25:39Z Lunch break ended. Lets continue mining some painite.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T14:02:46Z All done, cargo hold is full, hopper is full and I'm all out of limpets, aayeah! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now just updating TradeDangerous, then plotting course to the highest sell station for painite and off I go to that extremely risky return trip.
</p>

<p>
Tihtipihin/Thuot Hub sell price is 797,152 credits. Unfortunately that is 256ly and 31 jumps away, yeah I don't think I'm going there heh. Next highest selling is Kunti/Hughes Enterprise which is 182ly and 21 jumps away, its still a long way but that where I'm off to. Wish me luck <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Two interdictions, managed to escape but on the first they took my shields down and got just one or two hits before FSD engaged.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T14:42:13Z Docked at Kunti/Hughes Enterprise with a huge sigh of relief! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Watch youtube video of this scary return trip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdu_Epx26hc" target="_blank">Return From Mining 640t of Painite 2019-10-01 Elite Dangerous</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sold 640t painite for 487.6 million profit, when cargo hold got space then refinery outputted 10 more painite to sell so got 7.6 million profit from those. Total mining profit 495.2 million credits. Too bad it didn't go above magical half a billion mark heh.
</p>

<p>
That was very roughly 5hrs of game-play mining, seems I was a bit faster this time as last time time it took me six hours. It felt like I had better luck finding good painite mineral deposits so it was faster, less flying around prospecting.
</p>

<p>
All in all I would still say that if you want steady safe and interesting money maker, it is trading. Don't believe the mass hype in youtube etc with these make x credits per hour idiots who says mining is the best, it is not. Don't get me wrong I actually like mining, but in this scale its like a half a days ordeal to do it, with trading one hop is mere 10-15min depending on distances.
</p>

<p>
2019-10-01T14:46:25Z Decided to stop playing here, again it would require so much more work to top what I just achieved so better to end playing for today with a good feeling.
