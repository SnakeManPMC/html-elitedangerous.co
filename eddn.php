	<h2>Elite Dangerous Data Network</h2>

<p>It is a relay for market data stream coming from <a href="edmc.php">EDMC</a>, Maddavo's market share and other EDDN sender clients.</p>

<p>It is following the footsteps of Andreas Market Scraper and EDMN.</p>

<p>
Quote from EDDN github page: <i>Elite Dangerous Data Network is a tool that facilitates players of the game Elite Dangerous, including its expansions, sharing data about the game galaxy with others. By pooling data in a common format, tools and analyses can be produced that add an even greater depth and vibrancy to the in-game universe.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>EDDN is not run by or affiliated with the developer of the game - Frontier Developments.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The live EDDN service itself does not store any data, and thus makes no archive or "current state" available to anyone. What it provides is a stream of live data to any interested parties. Some of those then make aggregated data available for general use.</i>
