	<h2>2020-07-07 Will We Get Good LTD Prices Today?</h2>

<p>
2020-07-07T06:42:11Z New Elite day has started, CMDR Snake Man in the pilot's seat, looking forward to a brand new day. Will we get good LTD prices today?
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T07:07:39Z Started mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T08:20:15Z There were no carriers to buy LTDs and miners were getting desperate trying to find one. This is now third or fourth day of 1.1 million LTD market prices, all carriers are filled to the gills (or credits ran out) and miners have no place to sell except these 1.1 million paying stations.
</p>

<p>
If you have a lot of cash and two carriers... wait until prices go down and stay down for couple of days, then hit col 285 LTD3 rings and start offering to buy 900k per ton, you are making absolute fucking killing with such timing.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T10:05:36Z Finished mining, cargo hold full 704t LTDs and refinery bins 10t as well.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T10:14:57Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, offloaded cargo and carrier now has 9702t of LTDs, so close to ten kay hehe. Shut down Elite for a quick break, not long but just didn't want to leave client running.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T15:09:52Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, offloaded cargo and carrier now has 10,414t of LTDs. Well I broke the ten kay limit.
</p>

<p>
Then went off, but forgot limpets, docked at Phat's LTD Shop and got limpets, cooked food and had a lunch.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T18:41:53Z Finished mining, full cargo + refinery.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-07T18:47:02Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, offloaded cargo and carrier now has 11,126t of LTDs.
</p>

<p>
Uuh I'm starting to get pretty exhausted again, its been 14hrs day already, I don't think its good idea to push into one more mining trip, better to call it a night and watch tv or something, continue tomorrow hoping to see those better LTD prices. I really want to get selling and get more LTD buying business going on with better credit balance.
