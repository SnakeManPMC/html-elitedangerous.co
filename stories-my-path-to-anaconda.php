	<h2>Story Of How Did I Save Up To Anaconda Purchase</h2>

<p>My path to Anaconda Mar 2015</p>

<p>Anaconda in Jameson Memorial discount; 132.? million<br>
Trading cargo credits 8.2 million<br>
Insurance (lakon type-9) 3.9 million<br>
===<br>
<b>144.1</b> million</p>

<p>Here is the daily trades I did with my Lakon Type-9 to save up credits to buy Anaconda. These are daily amounts, not necessarily at exact same time every day but for me its daily stuff.</p>

<p>As summary the lowest earning day was PMCTODO and highest PMCTODO million credis earned. Its kind of difficult to state those as my gaming time was too irregular.</p>
