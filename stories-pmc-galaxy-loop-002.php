	<h2>PMC Galaxy Loop</h2>

<p>2016-08-06 started v2.1 Horizons - The Engineers for the first time. This was me coming back to Elite since Nov 29th, 2015.
</p>

<p>2016-08-06T05:52:47Z I departed to Snake Sector, arrived there 2016-08-06T06:48:30Z and visited few systems, like just checking out scenerys.
</p>

<p>I was using keyboard + mouse because earlier this year sold both my HOTAS systems (X55 and Warthog), keyboard + mouse was quite pain but I got used to it (it will take me few months before I can purchase HOTAS again).
</p>

<p>Then... I saw that Elite runs nice and I want to play some more but populated space don't appeal to me so why not start PMC Galaxy Loop right now. The decision was made <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-08-06T07:41:22Z departed towards "west" about 1000Ly. Idea was to just take it easy, pure enjoyable exploration mode without any rush. If I want to stop into interesting systems and do some SRV driving or if I get a rush and want to jump 5000Ly in one session, that's fine too. I really try to take relaxed attitude with PMC Galaxy Loop, its all about enjoying Elite and not trying to rush it.
</p>

<p>2016-08-06T11:07:46Z arrived at Stock 1 Sector JS-T d3-49, which is leg 01. Distance to Sol 1193Ly.
</p>

<p>At 1500Ly point I still saw quite a lot of other CMDR discovered systems, I guess the minimum range to hop out of populated space before not seeing discovered by CMDRs is like 2000+ Ly.
