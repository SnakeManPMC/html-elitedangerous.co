	<h2>2016-09-20</h2>

<p>2016-09-20 took several days break after getting the high score hyper jumps in a day, then did couple of days of 20 jumps per day and finished that today. Today we get v2.2 beta which I'm going to play like crazy, lots of cool new stuff and get to fool around in populated space, experiment with stuff as there is no consequences in beta. Will be good stuff.
</p>

<p>2016-10-25 Elite v2.2 was released. Started to play again in live game as I was earlier playing in the beta.
</p>

<p>Tested PMC EliteLog v1.1, Genar-Hofoen's Captain's Log 2 beta and Finwen's EDDiscovery v5.0.5
</p>

<p>2016-10-26T17:27:52Z talked with Eraktor about meeting in Colonia as he was headed there and I was quite close.
</p>

<p>2016-10-27T22:26:59Z okay so I started to jump in speed mode again, fastest route and I timed how quickly I can jump 20 times, it was 18min 30sec pretty even when I tested two times in a row. That is 1000Ly in my current Asp Explorer 51.66Ly jump range configuration.
</p>

<p>Speed jumping is just advanced discovery scan, quick system map check while FSD is charging and then jump into the next system.
</p>

<p>Heard that Eraktor got destroyed in server disconnect near neutron star, it is unknown if he will get to Colonia for meeting.
</p>

<p>2016-10-28T00:02:28Z arrived at Eolls Priae BQ-V d3-27, which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 05.
