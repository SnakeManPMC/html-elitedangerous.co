<p>
Note: in this page when I refer to "chasing the profits", it basically means fleet carrier crazy high profits, this doesn't apply for regular station to station trading.
</p>

<p>
When you get a new fleet carrier trading advert with very high or simply crazy profit, with poor luck it can be 100 or maybe even over 200 light years away, if you start to travel (hyper space jump) there with your Lakon Type-9 Heavy it will require refueling. This kind of journey will be extremely frustrating. Then once you reach the destination system, its a good chance you are already too late, other fast or in-system CMDRs have already traded several cargo runs and demand might be as much down as 50% or even more, leaving pretty much nothing for you, maybe one or two trade runs, if you're lucky.
</p>

<p>
Stop fucking chasing dreams, those big profits, just stick with close by fleet carriers, stay in popular system which has many carriers doing business like this, or just stick with regular trade runs from station to station using <a href="tradedangerous.php">TradeDangerous</a>, Spansh trade plotter or Inara trade routes. Overall if you spend one or two hours chasing best profits and failing miserably, imagine how much credits you could have done simply with spansh trade plotter beginning to trade immediately in the nearest station to your current location. There is no comparison.

As I'm writing this its 2025-03-17T06:12:38Z and CMDR Snake Man 1984 is grinding to his fleet carrier, I'm currently bag holding 790t aluminium because the fleet carrier I was going had already scheduled hyper space jump, I just got to normal space when I heard the call for 5min until lockdown. My mood was so fucking frustrated I had to stop and start writing this page. No more chasing profits, its waste of fucking time and drives you mad, if you do it too much including the "race trading againgst other CMDRs" it will frustrate you and make you want to stop playing elite! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

Edit 2025-06-06T15:45:35Z, yeah I remember that march 2025 time, I was really frustrated and fired up while writing that, it comes out as quite strong but I think its important to have that "raw emotion" in that paragraph to fully show how bad the mind-less profit chasing is. In that above example the trade race against other CMDR's was so fast paced that when fleet carrier owner was present and monitoring the situation, he immediately hyper space jumped away from the system once demand had been fulfilled. That is why I was left bag holding a cargo hold full of aluminium. Although now that I think back on it, cant recall how it played out, fleet carrier jump timer is 15min, now that is a life time regarding "carrier to station to carrier" roundtrip, so dunno there might have been something else going on, OR perhaps that was the first cargo run I was doing, I just cant recall the specifics. Final outcome was very unfortunate though.

There is much more fine details that go into "stop chasing the profits", how to try minimizing the issues like bag holding or traveling to fleet carrier advert only to see it being bogus or demand already almost or even completely gone, but that is more like a new page I have to write, this page is basically trying to warn CMDR's about the pitfalls of chasing crazy big profits on fleet carrier trading.
