	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

<p>
2020-06-21T00:50:00Z Finished mining, ran out of limpets. Got 8t LTDs and 362t tritium.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T00:56:12Z Docked at Dryu Aowsy AG-O d6-9/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Exited Elite, have to take a small break just a quick breather, that last mining session felt quite exhausting.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T01:15:32Z Had to call it a night, been up 15hrs and feel really exhausted. More mining tomorrow with new enthusiasm <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T09:01:43Z New Elite voyage home day has started! Yeah buddy lets mine some tritium!
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer fuel depot currently has 551t of tritium, so we need to mine 449t today. Should be easy to do as long as we have limpets hehe. Loaded PMC Miner 2 with full stock 512t of limpets.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T09:44:58Z Started mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T11:01:53Z First 123t mined.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T11:45:40Z Dead tired, have to go take a nap.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T14:44:47Z Nap is over, lets continue mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T15:47:45Z Lunch break, exited Elite for relaxing meal.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T16:20:53Z Lunch break over, we continue mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T17:59:26Z Finished mining, almost out of limpets and 450t of tritium in cargo (we need 449t according to our refueling schedule).
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T18:03:59Z Docked at Dryu Aowsy AG-O d6-9/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Then offloaded tritium into the fuel depot which status is now 1000t ie full. I have one extra tritium ton in type-9 cargo as well as 13t LTDs and 16 limpets.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to continue with the Spansh initial route but I don't think it really applies anymore as we are not in the refueling system currently and technically have one ton more tritium, heh yes sure one ton doesnt end the world heh of course not, but I decided to plot a new route from our current location, then scout ahead with PMC Explorer to find tritium hotspots and hopefully then I wont run out of fuel anymore.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer's cargo hold has now 21t LTDs, 1t tritium and 16 limpets. Total of 38t.
</p>

<p>
Spansh route plotter <a href="https://www.spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier/results/05AF67C0-B3EC-11EA-ADC5-F99694EB4526?destination=Col%20285%20Sector%20CC-K%20a38-2&market_capacity=38&module_capacity=550&source=Dryu%20Aowsy%20AG-O%20d6-9&tritium_fuel=1000&tritium_market=1" target="_blank">generated this route</a>.
</p>

<p>
60 jumps, estimated time 3 days and most importantly... eight (8) more refuelings, meaning several hours mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T20:00:57Z PMC Explorer arrived to the first carrier refueling mining system. Scanned it and yeah there are plenty of tritium hotspots to choose, none overlapping though.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T22:11:05Z Verified that Byoo Aim EP-R b46-0 system has icy rings with tritium I sent PMC Wanderer on its way here, two hyper jumps so will take a while.
</p>

<p>
While I wait, its lunch time <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T22:40:39Z Lunch time over, now we just wait until PMC Wanderer jumps into this system, ETA about 8min.
</p>

<p>
Tested first time that I can as carrier owner without outfitting service remove a mobule from my ship and store it in the outfitting, works OK. Not sure if there are any limits of how many modules you can store.
</p>

<p>
PMC Miner 2 was almost out of fuel so had to go to the system star to fuel scoop some, yeah PMC Wanderer has no refuel service hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-21T23:52:32Z Started mining.
