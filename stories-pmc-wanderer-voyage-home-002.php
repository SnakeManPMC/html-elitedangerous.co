<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

In this system I noticed spansh route plotter has made some detours so to speak, not following a direct line, also the jump distances were below 400ly. This must be because there has been "pristine" rings in all of these latest systems. I have to assume the plotter kind of tours all the icy ring systems for any possible tritium hotspots, lets CMDR pick and choose where to refuel.
</p>

<p>
I am planning on maxing out, taking a  risk, to jump two more systems before I need to refuel as I'm all out of tritium. If that system doesn't have tritium hotspot... then uh oh, I am in big trouble <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Finally arrived to this system where we are out of carrier tritium fuel, only 34t left in fuel depot <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So now I'm going out with PMC Explorer in hopes that there is tritium overlapping hotspot in this system, at worst... there could be nothing and I need to jump with type-9 all the way back fucking 400ly to the previous system ONE WAY haha <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
FSS scanned the system and could see from system map that the rings are icy but mass is tiny, super small rings so I doubt there are any good tritium deposits present. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T16:20:48Z And as I feared, it was a dud, only LTDs <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Used galaxy map to filer FGKABO hmm what else, stars and used economical route plotting when I went to hunt for gas giants or just icy rings in general.
</p>

<p>
Dryu Aowsy VQ-T c17-2 was the system where I found first icy rings, they were medium mass size and I was hopeful there would be tritium so my type-9 wont need to jump very far. But it was a dud, nothing in the icy ring, oh well search continues.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T17:28:57Z Uuh it was a struggle, but finally I found a tritium hotspot, two of them actually but no overlapping hotspots.
</p>

<p>
First I was flying aimlessly around hoping to find anything, but zip, nada, nothing. Then tried to find icy rings with Spansh body finder, it did... but I have no idea how to reference my current location there so the 10,000 results it found were useless. Next I tried EDSM and finally from its celestial bodies feature I found icy rings just nearby.
</p>

<p>
Well then PMC Miner 2 did not have jump range to reach the system haha, these issues just keep piling up hehe. Luckily carrier had JUST enough fuel to jump into the neighboring system where I'm sure PMC Miner 2 reaches the target system. It was so funny as after the carriers jump, it has 0.0 tons of tritium left hehe.
</p>

<p>
Talking about running out of fuel, huh! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T17:43:12Z Docked at Dryu Aowsy OB-Y b29-0/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
So arrived at the system next to the mining icy rings, time to get to work, I was anxiously sitting in PMC Miner 2's cockpit waiting to go.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T17:58:07Z Started mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T18:58:08Z Total of 134t tritium mined.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T19:26:14Z That's it, 203t tritium in the cargo hold, already too much to jump to the system where PMC Wanderer is heh, nice. Amazingly I could still jump out with 203t tritium and 3t limpets. Route even with fastest plotting still took me a 11 jump detour, that was interesting. It was funny to explore in mining outfitted type-9 haha.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T19:53:00Z Docked at Dryu Aowsy OB-Y b29-0/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
After returning safely to PMC Wanderer I took a much overdue lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T21:00:34Z Elite back up, donated 203t tritium to the fuel depot, then carrier course plotted to Dryu Aowsy AG-O d6-9 so I can continue mining tritium.
</p>

<p>
Its going to be fun mining while PMC Wanderer is on the orbit, not much hyper jumping to do and no pirates to worry about here deep in galaxy.
</p>

<p>
Plan is to mine 811t of tritium so after this carrier jump its fuel depot is full 1000t. Then we can continue using the Spansh fleet carrier route plotter course towards populated space. I really want to see how the route turns out in the end.
</p>

2020-06-20T21:17:16Z Docked at Dryu Aowsy AG-O d6-9/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Arrived to the gas giant, very nice orbit looking straight at the ring, wow what a view, got great screenshot and video out of it, awesome.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T21:38:30Z Started mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-20T22:25:25Z First 107t in cargo hold.
