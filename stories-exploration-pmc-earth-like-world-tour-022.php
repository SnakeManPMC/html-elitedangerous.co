2019-01-06T17:58:04Z I was back after few days break and after fixing Saitek X-56 HOTAS yaw pulling to the issue. Lets see if the yaw works and I can continue this exploration journey...
</p>

<p>
Continuing towards my next waypoint which in normal expanse 4,222ly and 70 hyper jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-01-06T19:28:31Z arrived at Zunoa OZ-L b35-11 system which is my ELW bookmark. Funny thing was that I was just hyper jumping after this few days break and did not pay attention to how many jumps left and all of the sudden I arrived to a system that was already discovered. I was confused that whaaat just happen until I checked system map and, oh, we've arrived hehe.
</p>

<p>
Few unexplored bodies, no specials.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 6240ly, 102 hyper jumps away. I already knew that I was not going to do this hop during this session, just didn't get into the exploration jumping mood for some reason, maybe I was tired dunno.
</p>

<p>
2019-01-06T19:46:27Z traveled few systems but then it was time to call it a day, just didn't feel like playing (tired or something).
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 77, special planets water: 6, planets smallest: 934.639km, largest: 69282.8km, detail surface scans: 359.
