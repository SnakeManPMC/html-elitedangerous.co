	<h2>2020-06-17 Elite Dangerous v3.7 Fleet Carriers Patch 1</h2>

<p>
2020-06-17T00:19:59Z Dropped into LTD ring.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T01:40:10Z Started to feel really exhausted and tired, been up over 16hrs straight mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T01:47:32Z Shut down elite, time to refreshen up maybe I could still squeeze in few more hours...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T02:02:19Z Had to call it a night, just way too exhausted and tired, more fleet carrier mining tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-06-17T09:50:00Z Elite servers were scheduled to go down for v3.7 fleet carriers release patch 1.</b> This included LTD sub surface deposit reduction, no more billions for miners heh, well ok not quite but yeah the lucrative days are over, no more four days from 90 million to a carrier.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T14:44:35Z Elite started. Looks like CMDR Snake Man PMC's carrier ID is now KNX-T6F.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T18:55:44Z Finished mining, yeah they definitely reduced the yields, I felt like this was taking a really long time and I only got 259t LTDs and 89t tritium. Hmm perhaps me mining tritium increased the time and feeling of it taking longer, hmm well obviously but like that much dunno.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T19:06:31Z Docked at PMC PapaBear and called it a night, just too hot in PMC Bunker (my apartment) +28.8C and I'm just sweating feeling extremely uncomfortable, did not have passion for mining/elite right now.
