<p>
Elite Dangerous Star Map (EDSM) is a community effort to store and calculate systems coordinates around the Elite Dangerous Galaxy.
</p>

<p>By registering to EDSM, you will be able to submit new star systems and distances to calculate new coordinates for these systems. You will also have access to shared flight log across a bunch of software who supports EDSM.
</p>

<p>Please note that elite star coordinator (edstarcoordinator.com) or EDSC is obsolete website and should not be used anymore, all your star system information should be stored to EDSM instead.
