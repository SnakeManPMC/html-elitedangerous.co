	<h2>2016-08-08</h2>

<p>2016-08-08T07:55:06Z arrived at Sifi FL-F c11-14, distance to Sol 2137Ly.
</p>

<p>2016-08-09T05:57:08Z decided to time how long time it takes me to visit 50 and 100 star systems in my relaxed and enjoyable exploration mode.
</p>

<p>2016-08-09T07:22:59Z had 50 systems explored. Found two water worlds and a ammonia world.
</p>

<p>2016-08-09T08:34:46Z had 100 systems explored.
</p>

<p>2016-08-15T15:45:52Z had to skip above the T tauri and L/Y dwarf star layer. I already encountered this earlier but managed to avoid it, now had to quickly jump above it so I can continue using economical route plotting towards my next goal star system.
</p>

<p>2016-08-16T13:51:47Z I landed on large icy body planet on Pru Eurk LX-L d7-54 system, it was 13k kilometers radius, quite large. Took an SRV out and... got pretty much stuck in edge on one massive crater. I started to run low on fuel and hull integrity so I recalled my ship fully aware that AI might damage it by its brainless landing methods... and it did, my ASP on 100% hull was banged down to 85% ! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I was 3541Ly from Sol and as I'm a man of princible... I plotted course back to closest space station for repairs. I will not explore, fly a ship that is below 100% hull integrity like some fucking newbie <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Yes it was 7000Ly round trip just to fix minor hull damage, but hey what can you do.
</p>

<p>Lesson learned, I will never ever play around in SRV on such large planet or at least not recall ship if there is no flat surfaces to land on.
</p>

<p>Fuck this sucks <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>New Yembo system was 3198Ly away, so I plotted course there.
</p>

<p>2016-08-16T17:01:26Z docked at New Yembo station. Repaired my ASP Explorer. Then headed back out again...
</p>

<p>2016-08-16T17:47:59Z reached Plaa Eurk LC-C d13-15 system which was about 1300Ly from Sol. First rest stop on my way back out where AI damaged my ship.
</p>

<p>2016-08-16T20:52:58Z arrived back to Pru Eurk LX-L d7-54 where the damage was done. Damn what a detour.
</p>

<p>The next day I jumped few new systems towards "west" as before the damage, then I decided to land on nice high metal content world. Well it was 1.3G world and this time it was totally my newbie mistake... I slammed into the surface causing 62% hull integrity damages. I did the good old clishe rage quit <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Well not really rage quit but I just watched the monitor with blank look in my face, then just ESC and exit to desktop... I was done. Even though I just started to play elite... heh I need a few days break as the above happening isn't very nice gameplay experience <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
