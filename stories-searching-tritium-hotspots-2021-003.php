<p>
Fleet Carriers use tritium as fuel source, you can mine tritium from icy planetary rings. This is a space exploration story about searching for resource rich tritium rings.

	<h2>2021-03-23 More Tritium Searching</h2>

<p>
2021-03-23T05:05:20Z Back in PMC Gaming, ready to explore Snake Sector some icy rings trying to find tritium hotspots.
</p>

<p>
To recap what I'm doing yesterday and today; I use galaxy map to filter non visited systems, then manually plot jump there, hardly never have to plot a route because everything is within jump range. Once in system I honk and everything is already discovered by other CMDRs because this is only 600ly from sol and its 2021 already. Then I check system map and if there are any icy rings I super cruise to them and surface map them to see if there are any tritium hotspots.
</p>

<p>
Why is Snake Sector undiscovered and visited stars cache wise not even visited on my part? Well I cannot remember back to 2015 but when I discovered Snake Sector the first time, started to code Elite Log and explore this system... sometime after that I had bunch of exploration data in first iteration of PMC Explorer asp and I got destroyed losing all that data. That is all I remember. So now I have huge gaps in discovered by tags because of that lost data. None of the visited stars cache systems I've been yesterday and today have had my tags in them, which kind of makes sense assuming visited stars cache is synchronized properly to where I have actually been. Maybe some Elite re-installs could have broken it dunno.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.

<p>
2021-03-23T08:05:04Z Feeding time is over, back to exploring icy tritium rings.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T08:51:51Z Found tritium hotspot at Snake Sector FW-W d1-37 11 ring.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T09:38:26Z Was snoozing off while flying so decided to stop for a moment, not taking a break or a nap, but just throttling back for a bit to get over this snoozing feeling. Don't want to crash PMC Explorer to a star or something ;)
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T10:01:24Z Back in action, heh looking at how many minutes it was, I must have dozed off ;)
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T10:14:55Z I had to call it, was snoozing off constatly and that gets your ship destroyed faster than self destruct.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T10:15:43Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 100 traveled distance: 1674.67Ly, planets smallest: 505.286km, largest: 76502.3km, detail surface scans: 686
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T13:53:11Z Elite back up after taking a few hours break and nap. Lets continue... to ... do, hmm, something. Not sure what to do really.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking about trying to mine for credits, which looks like alexandria is the highest paying mineral currently, but I have 48 billion in my real account and dunno how many single digit billions on second account, so I don't really need the credits.
</p>

<p>
Starting a long exploration journey now just less than a week away from Odyssey alpha release ... doesn't sound very smart either. The alpha is still far away from final release that a lot of time to explore but I'm just fearful that odyssey release might bring in something which would require me to be in the bubble. Not sure what that might be, biggest thing in odyssey for me is the new planet textures, so that shouldn't require for me to be anywhere near the bubble. But dunno.
</p>

<p>
I'll continue exploring rings for tritium mining now...
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T14:18:12Z Found tritium hotspot at Ophiuchus Dark Region B Sector UJ-R c4-15 a 2 ring.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T14:53:08Z Found tritium hotspot at Snake Sector UE-P b6-3 13 ring.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T14:57:56Z Found tritium hotspot at Snake Sector UE-P b6-3 14 ring.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T15:09:02Z Found four tritium hotspots at Snake Sector DL-Y d110 6 ring.
</p>

<p>
And now it was lunch break time.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T15:33:22Z Feeding is over, back to... well dunno what exactly, I think I need to switch from exploring tritium to something else now.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T15:44:49Z Docked at Snake Sector QI-S b4-3/Q1L-19Z. Back at PMC Wanderer, EDMC started to send 2500 messages to <a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm not sure what to do... what do I want or can do, hmm, good question. Wanted to go mine some minerals for credits, but I already have 48 billion so WHY would I do that. Wanted to go exploring 10k maybe 20k ly away... but that would be like one day of traveling with fleet carrier. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Really not sure what do do next. I guess I'm ready for odyssey alpha but that is still 6 days away, next monday (now its tuesday).
</p>

<p>
Hmm not sure if I could take out CMDR Snake Man PMC and PMC PapaBear to see whats its budget, it could perhaps actually need some credit making so mining a bit minerals and selling them would be fine. Hmm yes that's what I'm gonna do next.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T15:58:56Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 39 traveled distance: 990.483Ly, planets smallest: 387.736km, largest: 74741.5km, detail surface scans: 251
</p>

<p>
Shut down elite even though EDMC is still sending data, 750 messages to go so I wait before starting second account CMDR Snake Man PMC.
</p>

	<h2>Second CMDR Mining 2021</h2>

<p>
2021-03-23T16:22:25Z Switched netlogs and journals, backupped etc etc, then started CMDR Snake Man PMC account for mining operations in the bubble.
</p>

<p>
CMDR Snake Man PMC personal account has 100k credits, PMC PapaBear carrier balance 9.651 billion, tritium fuel depot full.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear modules/ships: 6719 units, markets: 1883 units, installed services: 2680 units, free space: 13718 units.
</p>

<p>
My ships are starter sidewinder, mining cobra, lakon type-9 miner, python for sub-surface deposit and laser mining outfit.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-23 CMDR Snake Man PMC Mining</h2>

<p>
2021-03-23T17:05:22Z Docked at Col 285 Sector UZ-P d5-90/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear is now on system for painite overlap hotspot ring, got this from victic's miner tool. 
</p>

<p>
Plan is to go mine some painite, just to see how it feels, then try to sell it, probably wont do even a one load for testing purposes. I have my doubts about selling stations working at all, I mean for anykind of proper good profit selling.
</p>

<p>
This system was in the bubble, there was maybe two dozen carriers or so, didn't count. I sent greetings cmdr's into system chat and nobody replied.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T17:16:09Z Dropped to Body: Col 285 Sector UZ-P d5-90 A 6 A Ring, started mining.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough this is supposed to be barely painite overlap, but all I found was platinum heh.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T18:23:15Z This didn't feel like overlapping location, got 13t platinum, 107t painite and 16t palladium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T18:28:07Z Docked at Col 285 Sector UZ-P d5-90/V4F-G4G. Offloaded minerals to carriers cargo, its contents now as above plus 1883t tritium and 51 limpets.
</p>

<p>
I really don't like this place as its in the bubble and spawns fake AI pirates to scan you. I'd like to hop outside bubble, but that would be tomorrows thing as its getting very late for me.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-23T18:31:40Z Shut down elite for CMDR Snake Man PMC, time to call it a night. Probably continue tomorrow to conclude this painite/platinum/etc high price mineral mining.
