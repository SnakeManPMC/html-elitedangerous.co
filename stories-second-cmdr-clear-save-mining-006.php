	<h2>2020-07-05 PMC Carriers Added To Inara</h2>

<p>
2020-07-05T04:56:45Z New glorious Elite day has started! PMC Miner 7 was parked in middle of cc-k a38-2 as I was listening to the system chat last night before crashed to bed. We are all rearmed and limpet up so lets head to the rings and start mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T05:02:15Z Started mining, well waiting until pirates disappear.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T07:55:29Z Full 704t of LTDs in cargo, aayeah, we are RTB.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T08:02:28Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer demand is 736t so 3511t bought at million per ton, if the market price goes to 1.6 or even 1.7 million... man we are going to make some crazy ass credits hehe. If price doesn't go that high today, no big deal I'll keep buying cheap because there is cargo and credits, I'll just mine with second account and advertise in system chat in the mean time.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T08:12:33Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear, refueled, rearmed, repaired and offloaded diamonds to cargo. LTDs in carrier now 1405t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T08:21:55Z Switched to real account, need to add more LTD buy order for PMC Wanderer, man do I wish there was web interface to do this stuff heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T08:29:00Z Checked PMC Wanderer demand left stats, tritium 12t and LTDs 534t, nice. I updated buy orders tritium 20t and LTDs 1500t, hopefully credit balance is enough not to cause that "sell bug".
</p>

<p>
CMDR Snake Man balance for ARX is 3057, been thinking of buying that carrier layout and texture, its silly, but dunno looks kind of cool.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T08:40:25Z Switched back to second account. For some reason neither of PMC carriers show up in inara now, they do in eddb, strange.
</p>

<p>
PMC carriers did not show up in inara so I asked Artie, he helped me out and uh oh I need to have account in inara and download the frontier data from there, this goes for BOTH CMDR's <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So I jumped though those hoops and now both PMC carriers show up in inara for the next 30 days, after that I need to refresh the frontier API thing from inara, uuh such an hassle, but hey gotta have them carriers in inara heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T10:27:28Z Dropped into LTD3 rings, back to mining.
</p>

<p>
On the first run at specific asteroid people call <a href="egg.php">"The Egg"</a> I got whopping 101t of LTDs, that was pretty nicely done.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T13:52:16Z Finished mining, 620t in cargo and only 11t limpets left so I decided to head back to PMC PapaBear, also PMC Wanderer has demand fulfilled so need to go there and figure out if I can squeeze in few more tons.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T13:58:01Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer as I saw from inara all the demand was fulfilled, very nice.
</p>

<p>
Here is some general mining with fleet carriers business info: when the bad market prices hit, miners are still mining and hungry to sell LTDs to carriers, highest station prices were 1.127 million, some carriers paid as high as up to 1.5 million for a while until their credits or cargo space ran out, rest were lowering their prices and were paying 1.2 - 1.3 million or so, I paid one million even with advertising no "sell bug" of course.
</p>

<p>
At these times when market prices go so low it would be a golden opportunity to have 23,000t carrier empty with 23 billion in cash to spend, then buy LTDs 1 million each and hold on to them until the price skyrockets to 1.7 and then just absolutely break the bank with profits.
</p>

<p>
If you'd get 700k profit per ton and you had 23k tons, it would be 16.1 billion profit!
</p>

<p>
But yeah with todays PMC budget that would not happen in a long time because the initial investment of 23 billion is crazy amounts, plus if FDEV wont fix the "sell bug" then you would need 46 billion total capital to pull that off.
</p>

<p>
Like they say, you need money to make money. But just fucking imagine that sort of deal, wow.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T14:13:11Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear cargo hold LTDs 2025t and tritium same 3857t.
</p>

<p>
I must say it feels like a lot of work for 2025t of LTD mining, my mood is that I should have more of that stuff by now, dunno maybe I have spent too much on the system chat although I am still mining and system chat monitoring is done by corner of my eye or during when collector limpets are doing their work, only very rarely I stop to write something etc there longer than 10sec.
</p>

<p>
This 2025t load of LTDs would pay 2.304 billion with the highest paying station Atlas/Cyllene Orbital with 1.137 million per ton. with those credits I could get very small buy order done, probably not worth the trouble. In any case 1.1 million is pitiful price of LTDs and I would never sell them at that price. I'll wait for days if necessary for the 1.6 hopefully 1.7 million market prices.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T14:19:18Z Switching to real account once again to check if anything can be done with PMC Wanderer current credit balance, I doubt it but gotta check anyways.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer now has LTDs 5245t and tritium 2118t. With current prices these diamonds would pay 5.968 billion heh. PMC Wanderer current balance is 3.119 billion, so lets assume we hit jackpot with 1.7 million LTD prices, it would make 8.916 billion and then fantasy balance would be 12.036 billion.
</p>

<p>
Oh well stop this fantasy calculating, its much more fun to get the job done and then see how much your balance is.
</p>

<p>
I created a new buy order, tritium 20t and 1535t LTDs. Not sure if this will break the selling as while I did not exceed 50% of my current balance, dunno if it works. At least I cant advertise it as no sell bug.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T15:21:37Z Then once again, switched back to second account hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T15:55:30Z Went to mining, forgot to rearm drill missiles, luckily had 56 left so did one round in the asteroid, got 84t of LTDs. Then went to check out highest paying carriers just so I can get some spending credits.
</p>

<p>
Docked on first and of course it was sold out.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T16:12:39Z Was kind of tired playing so went to cc-k a38-2 system to just sit in the normal space near the main star to monitor system chat if I might spot a high paying carrier there.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-05T16:39:20Z Docked at PMC PapaBear, back home at last. Rearmed and offloaded 84t diamonds into carriers cargo hold, its got now 2109t of LTDs.
</p>

<p>
I'm too exhausted of playing, need to call it a night here.
