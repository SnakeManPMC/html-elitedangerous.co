	<h2>2020-06-16</h2>

<p>
2020-06-16T02:33:21Z Too tired had to call it a night, zzz. More mining tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T10:40:57Z New mining day has started, elite back up, in-cockpit and ready to go.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T11:03:27Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/F90-Z5Q. All Under Heaven carrier, due Lu Pao system. Need to get them diamonds sold.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T11:21:52Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 362t of LTDs for 622.7 million, credits now 3.804 billion.
</p>

<p>
Regarding time used mining I feel like type-7 is too fast and type-9 too slow, in my sub surface deposit outfitting type-7 will get cargo hold full in less than an hour, type-9 does the same in about three hours.
</p>

<p>
Selling type-9 640t load often gets the bulk tax penalty for selling price, in that sense type-7 faster mining and smaller load would be better. But dunno, its difficult to find the best balance here.
</p>

<p>
I outfitted type-7 with laser mining and 256t cargo, no shields, no fuel scoop. This will be interesting experiment, how long till its full. <a href="https://is.gd/yQkiH9" target="_blank">edsy.org Lakon Type-7 Laser Mining Specifications</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:20:41Z Docked at Lu Pao/K72-W6Q. Carrier Duke of Edinburgh. Initially they had friends and squadron only but then opened docking access, odd.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:49:35Z Had arrived to the ring but needed to wait until wing of three fake scripted AI pirates disappeared.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:51:29Z First laser beam hit the asteroids, lets do this! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First ice cube was 30%+ and got me 9 LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T13:40:23Z First 100 LTDs done.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T13:53:51Z Cargo hold full, I got like hum 100+ limpets originally I think.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T14:54:16Z Refinery full, cargo hold 256t full. We're done here.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:03:51Z Docked at Col 285 Sector FN-J c9-15/L28-Z7Z. SS Shooting Star carrier, departing to Lu Pao system. Odd that they had no commodity market for LTD donating, oh well no payment from me then I guess (as I have no tritium).
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:32:17Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 256t of LTDs for 440.3 million, then 6 more from refinery got done and sold those for 10.3 million, credits now 4.259 billion.
</p>

<p>
I must have gone to switch back to Lakon Type-9 sub surface deposit miner ship here but forgot to write it down heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:50:34Z Docked at Lu Pao/W42-J8T. Boarded this carrier enroute to LTD rings.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T16:09:25Z Dropped into the LTD ring. Waiting for pirates to disappear.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T16:10:44Z First prospector limpet fired.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T17:36:12Z Cargo hold reached max capacity, 313t LTDs and 319 limpets.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:12:04Z Cargo hold full 640t and few in refinery bins. We're done here.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:35:32Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/L97-V2L. Carrier Elsie departing to Lu Pao system. Lets go sell some diamonds. Upon arrival donated (sold for 150k) one LTD for the ride.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:47:12Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 639t LTDs for 966.6 million, credits now 5.226 billion.
</p>

<p>
Took a little break here to catch up video editing, discord and having lunch as well heh. Man I needed a break after all that mining haha.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T20:45:53Z Elite back up, planning on my fleet carrier purchase. Mostly about where do I buy fuel and how long with it take to haul that crap.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T20:57:47Z Docked at Lan Tzak/Jacobi Platform.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-16 PMC PapaBear Is Born</h2>

<p>
2020-06-16T21:02:40Z Purchased CMDR Snake Man PMC fleet carrier called PMC PapaBear <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Ship ID is K64-P4N
</p>

<p>
Then had to figure out best way to refuel this beast and get it into action in Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2 mining LTDs heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T22:30:17Z arrived at Col 285 Sector BH-K a38-5 system. Decided not to refuel but to jump right into mining. This was the closest system I found.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T22:51:26Z Started mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T23:35:13Z Elite caused my GPU nvidia driver to crash so had to exit elite to recover. This mining trip was cut short. Next time I'll start elite up pirates appear and I have to jump out.
