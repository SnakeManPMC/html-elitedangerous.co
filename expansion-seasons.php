- mining - we want to make the processes of mining more involving and satisfying. it needs to be more than just lasering an asteroid. we want to expand the ways in which you detect and extract resources, give you a tool set, variety and choice in how you mine. importantly, we want invoke the feeling of wild west prospecting: jeopardy from crises and challenges out in the void, and the potential for striking it big finding the mother lode in special asteroids. our goal is to make mining a fully-fledged career, something that you can progress and work on.<br>
- planetary tech improvements - leading up to the q4 update we'll be making improvements to our lighting model, our scatter rock system, improving ambient effects, planetary phenomena, volumetric effects and vapour. these techniques will combine to create richer environments to explore in our q4 update. these are important steps in our ongoing planetary development. concept art: https://i.imgur.com/21dt3mx.jpg<br>
- exploration - we're going to significantly improve and build on exploration. the exploring flow will be more involved, more efficient and more satisfying. these new mechanics will also improve the experience for anyone searching for something, be that a mission or a particular resource. to support exploration we're adding the codex, an archive that logs your exploration achievements and acts as a repository for game lore. there will also be new phenomena, anomalies and other exciting things to discover.
