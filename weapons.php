<h1><b>PMC Elite Dangerous - Weapons</b></h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>List of all the weapons available. You can equip your ship with weapons and gear from the starport Outfitting menu.</h2>

<h2>Pulse Laser</h2>

<h2>Beam Laser</h2>

<h2>Multi Cannon</h2>

<p><b>Fixed</b> weapons obviously are the most accurate, they hit where you aim (its up to you to aim for enemy ships heh).</p>

<p><b>Gimbaled</b> weapons means that they turn slightly to follow your target, they are not turrets but they do help with aiming very nicely.</p>

<p><b>Turreted</b> weapons aim and fire on very wide arc on targets according to your specification in right hand side panel.</p>

<p>Not all hardpoints support all weapons.</p>

<p>I Bootis system, Chango Dock is the place where you find advanced weaponry to your ship. If you dont find what you are looking for, like for example the turreted weapons for Anaconda, then you must go out of the outfitting menu (possibly even exit whole game!) and come back, as the weapon availability is randomized every time.</p>
