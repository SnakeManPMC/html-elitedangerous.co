<p>
Fleet Carriers use tritium as fuel source, you can mine tritium from icy planetary rings. This is a space exploration story about searching for resource rich tritium rings.

	<h2>2021-03-22 More Tritium Mining</h2>

<p>
2021-03-22T04:40:29Z New elite day has started, plan today is to continue mining tritium with PMC Miner 3 python sub surface deposit and laser miner.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 125t limpets.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-22T04:45:59Z Dropped to the ring and first prospector limpet fired.
</p>

<p>
Today on this first run had a really bad luck, very bad ice cubes all around, did not find any four sub surface deposits, also ran back and forth few times as orientation got lost.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-22T06:18:22Z Cargo hold and hopper are full, 224t + 8t of tritium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-22T06:21:50Z Docked at Snake Sector QI-S b4-3/Q1L-19Z. Offloaded all the tritium into carrier, its cargo now is 15 LTD and 612 tritium.
</p>

<p>
And that concludes my tritium carrier refueling mining tests. Its... well, doable, not something you want to do if you are in a hurry to reach a destination but its fine to do as recreational mining so to speak. You buy tritium from the bubble meaning populated space then travel to your destination and if the destination is so far away that in return trip you run out of fuel, then you have to mine some tritium. Depending on the distance and your anxiosity level of getting there, this mining can be stressful grind.
