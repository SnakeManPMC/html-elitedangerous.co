2018-12-12T19:55:56Z was playing again after doing some C++ coding fixes for Elite Log, had the servers go down on me again (no pun intended). It was quite a long wait for servers being unavailable, usually when there are issues the servers let you in but then you lose connection or something, now I had to sit on my hands just waiting when the red "cant connect" was on main menu.
