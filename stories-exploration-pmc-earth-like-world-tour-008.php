	<h2>2018-12-17</h2>

<p>
2018-12-17T01:29:25Z nap time over back in Asp cockpit, plotted route to the next waypoint which currently is about 7.8k ly away.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T04:02:26Z at Byaa Broae ND-K d8-6 system found 21,395km radius ammonia world, my own highscore.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T06:10:09Z arrived at Choi Eork PL-F c14-0 system and found third (3) water world discovered by another CMDR, oh man this is getting old.
</p>

<p>
I'm pissed off because Elite Log registers that as discovered special planet, but its not, its tainted by the stink of another CMDR <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T06:32:21Z arrived at Choi Eork GL-W c18-0 system just in THE ABYSS sector <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T08:36:23Z arrived at Eishav MO-K c11-0 system which is bookmark 3.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is 4,707.63 ly away. Not very far, but this area so close to beagle point or at least the route to beagle point is heavily traveled by other CMDRs and every other system has been discovered. I really do not want to be here... can't wait to get this next earth like world cleared and then get the hell out of here.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T11:36:42Z arrived at Syre Thua OD-Z c27-1 system which is bookmark 4. This was 64,136.13 ly from sol. Horrible place as almost every system was discovered by CMDR, all I wanted to do is get the hell outta here <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then I plotted my course towards the next waypoint, due "south west". There will be the void between spiral arms, not sure if I can make it through with my 61.57 ly jump range PMC Explorer Asp. If not, I'll use jumponium and manual plotting.
</p>

<p>
The next waypoint was about 18k ly away but route plotter could not plot route.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T12:41:16Z arrived at Puwee LE-A b55-0 system and decided to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 259, special planets ammonia: 3, earthlike: 3, water: 19, planets smallest: 376.274km, largest: 77425.3km, detail surface scans: 1430, however I visited two earth like worlds which were done by me and several water worlds done by other CMDRs before I started to avoid those.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T22:13:30Z woke up and back in Asp cockpit, lets continue towards our current destination.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T22:53:16Z was returning from <a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/2146320/name/Pyrie+Eurk+TQ-G+c10-1" target="_blank">Pyrie+Eurk+TQ-G+c10-1</a> towards "south west" and every frigging system was discovered by CMDRs <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It is completely ridiculous what kind of tourist spot kindergarden the beagle point has become, which includes the route there and back roughly towards the core. I will never ever come back here as here is nothing for me to do as its so badly tainted by other CMDRs. I accept nothing but undiscovered systems!
