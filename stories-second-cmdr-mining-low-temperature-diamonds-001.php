	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Had an crazy idea that I'm going to <a href="multiple-accounts.php">switch to second account</a> and start <a href="mining.php">Low Temperature Diamond (LTD) mining</a> grind for credits to buy a Fleet Carrier <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
My second account CMDR "Snake Man PMC" had Lakon Type-7 from previous <a href="from-scratch-trading.php">Start From Scratch Trading</a> adventure. Plan was to mine LTDs and get a ride to best selling station from Fleet Carriers which taxi miners around.

<p>
2020-06-14T15:51:53Z CMDR Snake Man PMC was in-game, lets start grinding some credits <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Outfitted lakon type-7 with mining lasers, refinery, prospector/collector limpet controller and detailed surface scanner. I think my credit balance was somewhere around 90-94 million credits, not sure (would need to check journals).
</p>

<p>
Checked VicTics miners tool, Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2 is now the new LTD triple overlapping hotspot. Set my course there and off I go.
</p>

<p>
Lasers hit first ice cube about 1645hrs UTC.

<p>
I don't have any CMDR diary text for this but there are a lot of youtube videos for this mining.
