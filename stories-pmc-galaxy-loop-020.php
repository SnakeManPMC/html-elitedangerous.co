<p>2017-11-08T11:26:02Z day started when I was 752 light years away from leg 11, motivated to get back to populated space and FSD jumping a lot every day.
</p>

<p>Distance to Jameson Memorial 39,300ly
</p>

<p>2017-11-08T11:44:53Z arrived at Phrooe Blou AC-F c14-60 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 11.
</p>

<p>2017-11-08T16:00:00Z moved three route waypoints from the "outer rim" into the closer inner rim which is quite bit shorter route to populated space.
</p>

<p>I dunno man... I just wanted to get back there as fast as possible and besides if you just jump + honk + check system map, in endless loop without even scanning the stars to leave your exploration "piss trail", then whats the point going the long route? I mean I'm not here to enjoy some nice views, nebulas or other shit these blue eyed CMDR's seem to be doing.
</p>

<p>I was in Lyaisu AR-L b21-0 system with 38,287ly to Jameson Memorial. Now begins the longest quick jumping return to the populated space! hehe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2017-11-08T18:24:09Z arrived at Pha Free SY-S e3-6 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 12.
</p>

<p>Distance to Jameson Memorial 32,112ly
</p>

<p>2017-11-08-17T20:40:00Z had to call it quits because my computer desk chair broke down. The back rest cracked and leaned like 10 degrees too much back and there was danger that it would soon fully snap. I could not fly my ASP naturally or do any serious computer stuff like this <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>But I tried to play elite, I even brought my tv recliner chair in front of my Gaming computer but no go, I cannot reach my HOTAS, well throttle full forward when I sit in the recliner, not to mention getting in and out of it is pure horror. So that was not an option.
</p>

<p>Right now I don't have money to buy new computer chair, so if I cant use my computers other than short periods of time without back rest, it means no Elite playing either. Once again PMC Galaxy Loop is on hold <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Damn man, this exploration journey seem to be riddled with all kinds of mishaps hehe. Wonder if I ever make it back? HEHE
