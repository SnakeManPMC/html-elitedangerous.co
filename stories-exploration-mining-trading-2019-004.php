2019-09-10T04:36:44Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 128, planets smallest: 291.494km, largest: 76905.5km, detail surface scans: 329

<p>
2019-09-10T15:19:11Z New day has started, already ate and now back in elite, in my python cockpit at jameson memorial, lets mine some painite.
</p>

<p>
Stripped PMC Miner python from modules and then sold it. Purchased Lakon Type-9 and named it PMC Miner 2. My credits currently 3.830 billion.
</p>

<p>
Outfitted PMC Miner 2 with decent mining loadout. Edit: but I made mistake to outfit only 2x 3A collector limpet controllers which is WAY too little for mining.
</p>

<p>
My first mining target system was HIP 73269, A1 ring A.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T16:17:28Z arrived to the A1 ring A and had no painite hotspots, eh? Then choose next mining site Xi-2 Lupi, A2 ring A, it was 59.3ly and 8 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
It is really painful to travel with that slow type-9 heh. I just wonder how many millions would you had made in this traveling time by doing normal trading as one hop pays like several millions.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T16:33:58Z arrived to the A2 ring A and there was no overlapping hotspots for painite. Umm second in a row now, does edtools.ddns suck or what?
</p>

<p>
Decided to head out for HIP 80266, 6 ring A. This system is 12 jumps away, ugh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T16:54:56Z arrived at HIP 80266 system.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T16:59:38Z probed Body: HIP 80266 6 A Ring, found one painite hotspot, looking good.
</p>

<p>
Keelback miner joined me there, no police or pirates in sight. Started to prospect and okay amounts of painite came up from the rocks. I only had 2 collector limpet controllers which was quite low number and there was fair amount of waiting time after shooting mining lasers into the asteroids.
</p>

<p>
Mining is relaxing, but indeed it takes a really long time with 2 collector limpet controllers and type-9 7D thrusters. But yes, very relaxing being all alone among the rocks in planets rings.
</p>

<p>
I'm still thinking constant steady normal trading is overall the best money maker.
</p>

<p>
You definitely want to take more than 2 collector limpet controllers its just way too slow with two. Sure you want to maximize the cargo load you haul back, but not with the expense of mining taking twice as long.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T18:41:52Z currently 147t of painite in the cargo hold, this is really boring and slow pace so it feels frustrating. well frustratingly boring. I am going to try some trading today with my good old Lakon Type-9 to see what kind of results do I get from eddb trading info.
</p>

<p>
Also worth to note that if you have type-9 cargo hold almost full like crazy 500t plus, then you get interdicted by stupid fucking fake ass scripted AI ships and get destroyed... oh man, imagine the RAGE you would feel at that point. Every minute and every ton you mine, increases the risk of loss if interdiction happens on the way to the sell station.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-10T20:27:14Z this is now 3h 27min later and only 286t of painite mined. Yes this was my fault for not outfitting more collector limpet controllers as that is what I have to wait for so long after each mining laser blast. But yes also finding more than 20% painite rocks takes a while.
