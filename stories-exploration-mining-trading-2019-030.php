2019-10-05T12:45:37Z New elite day has started, did some coding for Elite Log tool which helps me great deal to write these CMDR diarys you are reading now. Elite Log automatically writes now UTC and "Docked at SYSTEM/STATION." for me which is great.

<p>
Alright todays plan is... the same as yesterday, continue visiting stations in eddb closest missing page.
