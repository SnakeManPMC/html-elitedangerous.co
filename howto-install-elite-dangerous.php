	<h2>HOWTO Install Elite Dangerous</h2>

<p>First you must purchase the game by registering account into <a href="https://www.frontierstore.net/" target="_blank">frontier store</a>, you'll find <a href="https://www.frontierstore.net/games/elite-dangerous-cat.html" target="_blank">Elite Dangerous</a> category in there.
</p>

<p>Then you purchase the game. After the purchasing process is done you'll get the game title to show up in My Products page.
</p>

<p>Click and download the elite client installer exe from My Products page. This is the installer that is used to, well install the game. The installer is <i>not</i> the game, you use the installer to download the game from internet.
</p>

<p>If you have trouble finding the installer link, here is the direct link to <a href="http://hosting.zaonce.net/elite/Client-Installer.exe" target="_blank">hosting.zaonce.net/elite/Client-Installer.exe</a> file.
</p>

<p>Run the installer and point to some proper directory (not c:\program files\ oh no) and wait, depending on how busy frontier servers are and what is your internet connection speed (and location), it will take a while for the download and install to complete.
</p>

<p>Once the game has been installed you can Login with your email/password you created in frontier store.
</p>
