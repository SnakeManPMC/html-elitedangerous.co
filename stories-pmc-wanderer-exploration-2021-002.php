	<h2>2021-03-30 Fleet Carrier Hyper Jump Traveling</h2>

<p>
2021-03-30T08:28:53Z New Elite day has started, we continue towards our exploration destination area.
</p>

<p>
As a recap, PMC Explorer is now in Byaa Eurk IP-Y b55-0 system, PMC Wanderer is one waypoint behind and unfortunately with only 97t of tritium in fuel depot so I have to actually jump back there with PMC Explorer, switch to PMC Trader and refill that depot. Off we go.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T08:46:44Z Docked at Byaa Eurk XV-L c21-13/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, <a href="edmc.php">EDMC</a> is sending exploration data so I better sell it as well on universal cartographics.
</p>

<p>
Then switched to PMC Trader, filled it up on tritium, refilled carrier fuel depot and plotted the next jump. Then it was breakfast time while watching Elite odyssey twitch live streams while waiting carrier countdown timers <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2021-03-30T11:30:39Z Had to shut it down to take a nap, was snoozing off while watching twitch live stream.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T13:44:36Z Back in Elite, lets continue our exploration journey.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T13:44:25Z Docked at Prieleae SP-G d10-215/Q1L-19Z. This is the system where PMC Wanderer jumped while I went to take a nap, now its fuel depot is down to 8t left so it needs a refill which I did from PMC Trader's cargo, just enough for the next jump, 116t.
</p>

<p>
Currently there was no good twitch live streamers doing odyssey, it was not about odyssey but to watch my favorite streamer play it so I can learn how bad the stupid infantry weapon combat is without needing to try it myself. So I had to watch something else and that got me bored, I wanted to go explore again but at least next jump will be in the hangar.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:04:16Z Docked at Prielo YG-X b56-6/Q1L-19Z. Donated 123t tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:17:47Z Yup I'm bored for twitch streams as there is nothing to watch and I have nothing to do when traveling in this PMC Trader tritium refueling setup, that 20min timer countdown delay is so boring its just unbearable.
</p>

<p>
I have a jump plotted now but once this is done I'll top off tritium in fuel depot and switch back to PMC Explorer and start to jog along the carrier, or perhaps behind her, dunno. Going to grab something to eat now so one more jump after this before switching over, lets hope some good twitch streamer goes live by then hehe.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T14:25:17Z Docked at Ellaic IF-R c4-75/Q1L-19Z. Donated 121t tritium to fuel depot.

<p>
2021-03-30T14:46:15Z Docked at Ellaic AL-P d5-207/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Topped carrier off with 1000t tritium in the depot, then switched to PMC Explorer asp and went to explore towards the next jump point.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T16:45:37Z Had to restart elite as FSS scanner was really zoomed in and objects squished in it.
</p>

<p>
BTW also really disappointed about odyssey from what I'm seeing from twitch live streams, its mindless COD quake dancing & frag garbage. For me the only thing in odyssey is the walking and new planetary tech (meshes, textures, lighting etc), I will never EVER play those quake dancing & frag bullshit missions, never <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T16:51:11Z Elite restarted and FSS scanner works fine now, we continue.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-30T17:25:24Z Docked at Blie Phlai LX-L c7-63/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer visit as ... well I'm again getting so bored its just not enjoyable to explore. Need to sell exploration data and <a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a> send it, also one more jump left fuel in carriers tritium depot so need to top that off as well.
</p>

Switched to PMC Trader, filled it up with 790t of tritium then added hundred some tons to tritium fuel depot. Ready to jump into next system.
