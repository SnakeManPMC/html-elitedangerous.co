<p>2015-04-23: Thursday; youre done with neutron stars, head back to populated space! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-23T14:43:23Z: my voyage to home started. I was 15,942Ly away from Sol. Decided to travel by doing hop 1000Ly and then to stop to surface scan 5 systems, then continue with next 1000Ly hop looping like this until reach populated space. It was a good decision because on first hop (stop?) I found two water worlds and one earth like world <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
Looking at this exploration diary, just realized I was out two weeks to explore, wow nice.</p>

<p>2015-04-24T04:35:14Z: arrived to Snake Sector NN-T c3-13</p>

<p>2015-04-24T05:07:36Z: arrived to Woriosolis system (alliance) and was immediately interdicted, yikes! But I escaped. Then I proceedd and docked at Bugrov Freeport. Then off to sell exploration data.</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 37,791,676 and after 113,102,226 so made total of 75,310,550 credits.</p>

<p>2015-04-24 status:<br>
Exploring<br>
131,7 million</p>

<p>When selling the exploration data I got 75 million, which was not enough for exploration Elite status, I was super devastated. I felt like I just absolutely cannot explore anytime soon after this exhaustive set I did now... and it wasnt fucking enough <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>As conclusion for this April 8th - 24th exploration journey, I must say it was really exhaustive, scanning those neutron stars was tedious as was the traveling of 1000Ly hops, the constant jumping and advanced discovery scan pinging. I played on most days all day with just eating breaks. It gets to your head, into your mental health when you hammer this kind of hardcore playing.</p>
