<p>2015-09-14T08:43:07Z: docked at HR 1064 and sold cargo, then purchased Hauler with plan to head to my python which was 69.52Ly away. Stopped for refuel at Palekereg Haldeman Terminal. Then arrived to Niflhel system, docked at Biruni Port at 2015-09-14T09:18:48Z. Fly my Python to Shinrarta Dezhra, Jameson Memorial station and arrived there 2015-09-14T09:38:25Z.</p>

<p>Now its time to purchase ship that can travel great distances quickly but also defend itself, I'm going to track down those stations that have very old data in trading tool databases, ie EDDN based like TradeDangerous (Maddavo's Market Share). Going to visit them and use ED Market Connector to send market commodity data to EDDN. Its going to be fun <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>So purchased ASP and outfitted it with 33Ly jump range, best fuel scoop, basic shields and gimballed pulse lasers. This way I can travel great distances quickly but also defend off any AI interdictions. Then I left and started to explore TradeDangerous olddata systems. Soon after I chatted with Maddavo and he told me about his sites editstation page which is great for tracking down Large landing pad stations without commodity market prices, so I started to visit those.</p>

<p>2015-09-16T05:49:10Z: arrived to HR 1064 where my Lakon Type-9 is parked, time to do few trade runs for a change.</p>

<p>I had left 20 hop trade route (from TradeDangerous, of course) half way through earlier so I completed it now. Quite nice route with couple of looping systems at the end, good profits.</p>

<p>_Dastardly_ ultimate gold trade route, 60 hops. I decided to try this trade route out as I read about it in Frontier forums.</p>
