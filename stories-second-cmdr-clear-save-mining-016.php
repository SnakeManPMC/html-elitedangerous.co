	<h2>2020-07-15 Elite v3.7 Patch 3 The Death Of LTD Mining Business</h2>

<p>
2020-07-15T10:00:00Z Upgrade was available, goodbye The Egg, goodbye SLF exploit, goodbye LTD craze era.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T10:24:13Z Elite booted up, in-game. Now we see what happened to LTD mining and The Egg.
</p>

<p>
The EGG is dead, its now 4 bromellite sub-surface deposits without any LTD content, at all. Oh my! <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713225880792596491/732908609301774376/2020-07-15T1036-Elite-Screenshot_0001.jpg" target="_blank">2020-07-15T1036-Elite-Screenshot_0001.jpg</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T11:39:29Z Docked back to PMC Wanderer, 2020 LTD craziness era is over, I'm about to cry ... <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After doing that small prospecting run on col 285 sector cc-k a38-2 LTD triple overlapping hotspot "middle" hotspot by where The Egg used to be, it became clear that <b>FDEV COMPLETELY fucked up patch 3, LTD's are simply gone, they are not there anymore</b>, I did not find a single fucking one laser mining LTD asteroid. FDEV really messed up this patch, carriers also have some 2 billion credit buy order bug, it wont allow you to create larger buy orders, heh this is just silly <img src="../images/smileys/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Smiley :rolleyes:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Looking forward of seeing an hotfix, they simply cannot leave patch 3 like it is now.
</p>

<p>
Fuck this, I'm going to sleep...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T18:00:00Z about this time was already up and reading discord that how has the dust settled from patch 3 and it doesn't look good. LTD mining is dead, there are no LTDs to be found, fleet carriers are broken with the fucking 2 billion buy order limit etc. Situation looks grim, at best.
</p>

<p>
Merged all remaining video clips, it was emotional to even watch my last departure from col 285 LTD 3 ring in the video, heh oh man.
</p>

<p>
Now my feeling is that mining is dead, fleet carriers are useless for trading purpose... I might as well go back playing <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org" target="_blank">Farming Simulator 19</a> now, I'm seriously considering it, would give some time for Elite to be fixed and dust really settle from cruel execution of LTD mining. Dunno, will have to make decision after reading a bit more discord/frontier-forum.
</p>

<p>
DSSA Gnauty posted frontier forum topic about tritium being 90% reduced, stranding carriers as it takes insane amount of time to mine tritium now, it was horror before and now its sheer murder, its just fucking ridiculous. There is no fucking way anyone could explore with fleet carriers anymore <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was reading discord and forums, people were outraged by this.
</p>

<p>
I made my decision, I'll stop playing Elite until this has been fixed or FDEV announces it works as intended.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T18:52:00Z Muted all elite discord servers, shut down elite launcher and started to think launching FS19 for some nice farming.
</p>

<p>
The End.
