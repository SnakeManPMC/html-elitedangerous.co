	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

<p>
Onboard PMC PapaBear was 24t LTDs, 5516t tritium and 69t limpets. Services; refuel, armory so total of 24,250t free cargo space.

<p>
2020-06-22T22:46:30Z Alright first 788t tritium load delivered to PMC PapaBear. Time to put out the tritium market buy order.

Calculations for market buy order, tritium one load costs; 4 million * 15 loads == 60 million. I'll leave that to my personal account and transfer rest to PMC PapaBear.
