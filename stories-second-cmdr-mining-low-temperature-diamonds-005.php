<p>
2020-06-18T00:58:58Z Back in-game, at the LTD ring, lets mine some minerals.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T03:02:18Z Decided to end mining trip with 162t LTDs and 69t tritium in cargo hold. I want to go explore with my real account hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T03:14:57Z was flying towards PMC PapaBear and took a screenshot F10 while avidemux was merging video files... elite crashed heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Next gaming session will be exploration again with real account.
</p>

<p>
Apparently I didn't write down what happened in-between here, did I do some real CMDR account exploration or what, cant remember heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T14:43:35Z Back in elite, lets see if we can do some carrier taxiing CMDRs to the sell systems.
</p>

<p>
Looks like we got new LTD pricing again. Fresh outta TradeDangerous:

<p>
Started transfer of type-9 and diamondback explorer into PMC PapaBear, eta 25min.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T18:08:25Z Docked at Newman Orbital, winged up with CMDR fubber, sold 534t LTDs for 918 million but unfortunately we did not get trade dividends, it bugged out.
</p>

<p>
Haven't been keeping track but I did at least couple of carrier taxi rides for miners, got some tritium and LTDs donated. Many thanked me / PMC PapaBear for the ride and overall the atmosphere was real nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T20:29:13Z After a lunch break back in diamondback explorers cockpit onboard PMC PapaBear. Lets now keep a track of our tritium and LTD stats so we can see how much commanders donate.
</p>

<p>
Currently we have 491t tritium in the fuel tank, commodity market demand 992t tritium and 2481t LTDs. Carriers inventory has 19t LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T20:57:56Z Tritium fuel tank 455t and nobody donated any LTDs, at all. they are exactly the same numbers, wow, free ride eh?
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T21:55:22Z Tritium fuel tank 432t and nobody donated any LTDs, at all. However this is departure from LTD ring to selling station, so they might donate after we reach the destination.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T22:14:54Z Arrived at Oceliu Anat. Tiritum fuel tank 473t and commodity market demand 948t tritium and 2478t LTDs, someone donated, great.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T22:43:37Z Elite crashed on return hyperspace jump heh. When arrived tritium fuel tank 437t so someone donated, nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T23:09:34Z In Oceliu Anat, tritium fuel tank 401t and commodity demand 2476t LTDs, so two diamonds donated, nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T23:43:02Z In LTD ring end of trip again, tritium fuel tank 365t and no commodity changes as expected on return trip when miners are empty.
</p>

<p>
In general I must say that this stuff ain't paying off, not really. I mean sure I got some tritium donations but those wont even match the fuel used not to mention the cheap price they have and the LTD donations have been very few, like on this last jump mere two (2) were donated. Sure its somewhat OK credits if we compare it to tritium buy price, but yeah... I'd say its mostly running without much profit, not even close to breaking even.
</p>

<p>
At this moment I'm just about ready to stop and do something else. Well I have been playing like ten hours straight now too.
</p>

<p>
Did one more trip to Oceliu Anat.
