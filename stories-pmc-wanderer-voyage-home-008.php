<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

Was really tired almost snoozing off in front of the computer so what I did was plot a hyper jump, set alarm timer on phone for 19mins and then went to bed to sleep. Well it was not proper sleep with such short intervals but oddly enough it helped me get through several hyper jumps. The other choice was to go take a legit nap meaning shutting down Elite and Gaming computer, then sleep for like 2-4hrs. I have done this 19min nap now two times and who knows maybe I'll try it again in the future if I have such crazy carrier traveling plan.

After this Elite bugged so that carrier jump sounds, going to hangar and the leaning back animation things were totally skipped. Carrier did move on galaxy map but nothing was written in journals. Really strange, I don't mind as the hyper jump sounds were just waste of time. I'm just hoping this bug / glitch doesn't throw me back dozen or so systems all of the sudden.

<p>
2020-06-25T02:02:50Z Carrier jumping is still bugged, but I'm still... jumping closer to the bubble so I don't care <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Did couple of jumps by going to sleep for 19mins again, I have no idea if I should really go to sleep or are these just "yawns for pussies" which don't mean anything.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-25T06:57:17Z Elite galaxy servers go down in top of the hour for weekly maintenace. Had to stop carrier hyper jumping.
