I have not paid attention to Elite Dangerous news and community, could this perhaps be some special 2024 october autumn sale, or are these lowered prices (for example Odyssey is ridiculously cheap) permanent, no idea. There is this from 2023 <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/elite-dangerous-seasonal-sales" target="_blank">Elite Dangerous Seasonal Sales</a> but nothing for 2024.
