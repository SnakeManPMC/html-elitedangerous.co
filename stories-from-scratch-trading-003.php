	<h2>2019-09-14 Clear Save</h2>

<p>
I wanted to do small scale trading with my second account as my real account has 4.8 billion credits and the trading just doesn't feel like its going anywhere even though I'm making 3-6 million per hop in average. Also so much of the trading values, commodities and GUI have changed since I last did this that it would be interesting to see how it turns out this time. Wanted to clear the save (second account!) and start from scratch.
</p>

<p>
Went through all the hoops to switch into CMDR "Snake Man PMC" login.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-14T21:20:00Z started new save from Asellus Primus/Baker's Prospect.
</p>

<p>
But immediately had problems because EDMC started sending CMDR "Snake Man" exploration data from about 10k ly away into EDDN and EDSM. I did untick the EDDN and EDSM sending but it was too late, EDSM was already updated with my clear save info (I deleted the asellus primus flight log though) and EDDN received dunno how many hundred scan data from my real account. Sigh.
</p>

<p>
Oh well lesson learned about how to use EDMC with second account, I was trying to be careful with it but mistakes were made.
</p>

<p>
Anyways back to trading. I declined the 10k credits charity offer mission, I want to trade and trade only, no fake money.
