	<h2>2017-10-30</h2>

<p>2017-10-30T10:37:21Z was back in cockpit and set my sights to route towards PMC Galaxy Loop leg 09.
</p>

<p>I found several earth likes and water worlds near beagle point but because they were discovered by other CMDR's I didn't go scan them even for the basic money. Biggest payday is the first discovery bonus anyway.
</p>

<p>2017-10-30T16:53:56Z for some reason route plotter refused to plot route anywhere near leg 09, so I just went and plotted to leg 10 instead, oh well. I was about 1.4k ly away from leg 09 so it was close enough.
</p>

<p>2017-10-31T11:01:58Z arrived at Plaa Chroa MC-M d7-96 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 10.
