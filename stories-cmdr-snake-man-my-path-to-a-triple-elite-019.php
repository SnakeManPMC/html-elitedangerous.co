<p>2015-11-12T14:35:06Z: needed a break for conflict zone grind, decided to make some credits and test bit more extensive how anaconda works in resource extraction site bounty hunting at lavigny duval 20 percent passive bonus system of LTT 2667.</p>

<p>Enjoyed the high intensity resource extraction site combat greatly, spend several hours there and by some miracle there was almost constant action and usually high ranking ships too which is great for my combat rank progression. Made also lot of credits, one ~3 hours stretch got me 6,4 million in bounties.</p>

<p>2015-11-13T04:52:03Z: End of the day was Dangerous 57% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-13T16:03:28Z: End of the day was Dangerous 64% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-13T19:00:00Z: v1.5 beta was released, I might take few hours if not days to test this out. I don't plan on testing for extended period of time as I get no combat rank gains, but remains to be see how much v1.5 beta playtime I get.</p>

<p>2015-11-13T23:12:06Z: After seeing how the developers nuked shield cell banks in v1.5 beta, I quickly launched v1.4.01 back up and continued my combat rank progression task. I decided that now I'm going to grind combat rank all day every day until I reach Elite, because certainly the combat takes a big hit in v1.5 as shield cells banks are becoming practically useless.</p>

<p>2015-11-14T02:00:00Z: End of the day was Dangerous 71% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-15T03:22:28Z: End of the day was Dangerous 86% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-15T14:54:49Z: arrived at Kaushpoos system with intentions to take part in the bounty hunting community goal.</p>

<p>Sometime during this time I received my highest bounty from Anaconda 405,020 credits. Now that is some juicy bounty!
