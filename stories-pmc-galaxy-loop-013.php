<p>2016-11-14T12:27:24Z arrived at Eolls Priae BQ-V d3-27 which is the same system I was before departing to Colonia, this was the PMC Galaxy Loop leg 05.
</p>

<p>This Colonia detour was mostly done jumping max range, ie speed jumping. I'm hoping to return back to using economical route plotting and getting back to relaxed exploration where I have no hurry to get anywhere.
</p>

<p>Now we continue in our journey, we head towards "north" in which is the furthest out we have ever been. This is exciting! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-11-14T14:22:48Z reached Dryua Priae CA-C c2-2 system, switched to use economical route plotting with plan on surface scanning all stars now and really taking a relaxed attitude to exploration once again. No more speed jumping 20 FSD jumps in 18min and 30secs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Went on like this for I think two thousand light years (two route plots), then had to do some EliteLog testing with longer jump ranges and got stuck there not really speed jumping but with fastest route plotting.
</p>

<p>On a side note from this trip, I get motion sickness from driving the SRV, if I absolutely must drive, I turn on all the lights in my room and sit as far back as I can from the monitor / keyboard and try to minimise the time driving. And yes I do have the HMD motion sickness things enabled in elite options, no idea if those help or not, well not enough anyways.
</p>

<p>I decided that for next exploration journeys I will not bring that useless SRV with me, I mean all its worth is getting "jumponium" FSD boost materials and taking screenshots, so why bother. I can land my Asp and take screenshots from there.
</p>

<p>However dunno if its one of these things that its better to have it and not need it... like if you leave it out and go exploring, then you WANT to have it with you. But I haven't found such interesting landable planet so far while exploring where I MUST drive SRV, so dunno.
