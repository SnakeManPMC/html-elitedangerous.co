<p>Next I had a just over <b>three months break</b> from Elite as I just was so burnt out for exploring and everything. Note: I did not play other games either.</p>

<p>2015-09-05T23:40:58Z: Started to play again and arrived to: Snake Sector PD-S b4-3. Plan is now to finish once and for all exploring the rest of Snake Sector.</p>

<p>2015-09-09T23:02:27Z: at Snake Sector GM-V c2-10 when I found latest water world, I felt so bored with the tedious exploring of this sector because it just seems so endlessly large, you constantly wait for the exploration to be complete but still more and more Unknown systems show up in navigation panel, very demoralizing and boring.
<br><br>
Its boring especially because this sector is mere 600Ly away from populated space and actually at the route towards galaxy core, with bonus nebula too... so pretty much all the systems are almost fully explored by CMDR's already (while the game hasn't been out even a year yet, Elite has great community).
<br><br>
I thought that its not worth doing something extremely boring and tedious, so I decided to head back to populated space to sell this 5 days worth of exploration data. Now I know it is not enough for me to reach Elite ranking but still, why do something which makes your mind go numb and almost gives you stress.</p>

<p>BTW please note that I'm not blaming elite for this, elite is not boring, the problem is me... I'm just playing it all day every day without breaks even which is way too much over long period of time. Its just not healthy. I dont give damn what game you play, with this much they all burn you out...
</p>

<p>credits before selling: 24,215,624 after selling: 34,963,742 so made total of: 10,748,118 credits.<br>
exploration profits before: 142,135,626 after: 152,883,744</p>

<p>The above sums means I'm approximately 6 million exploration profit away from reaching Elite ranking.</p>

<p>Exploring systems in one day, record 567, but very good day is above 400. You're lazy if its below 150. Basically 31 jumps is 1,000Ly.</p>

<p>2015-09-10T04:44:22Z: at Shinrarta Dezhra, got motivated by getting so close to Elite rank that I decided to man up and head back out to Snake Sector to explore until I ran out of Unknown systems or I spend three full days exploring. I believe three full days is enough to get me six million in profits.</p>

<p>2015-09-10T05:05:17Z: arrived to Snake Sector DL-Y d60, exploration continues. Let's do this!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/SnakeManPMC/elite-EliteLog" target="_blank">PMC EliteLog</a> tool I reached 10,000 total jumps when I jumped to Snake Sector GW-W d1-85, 2015-09-11T00:02:35Z, heh cool.</p>
