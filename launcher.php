<h2>Launcher</h2>

Download official <a href="http://hosting.zaonce.net/elite/Client-Installer.exe" target="_blank">Client-Installer.exe</a> from frontiers homepage.

<p>
When you start the launcher it will ask to upgrade itself if newer version is found. Click Yes and it open browser pointing into hosting.zaonce.net/elite/Client-Installer.exe link. Download and install this "Client-Installer.exe" to proceed.
</p>

<p>
When setup asks install directory, it should offer the existing one you currently have. <b>Use this</b>, so you don't lose your existing log and other config files by selecting new / wrong directory.
</p>

<p>
When setup is done, start the launcher.
</p>

<p>
You most likely have to type in your elite dangerous login info now. Click Log-in button and type username/password. Wait for email you get from frontier and type in verification code from it.
</p>

<h2>Upgrade</h2>

<p>
If you have elite upgrades available, just click the Upgrade button and wait patiently.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the popularity of elite upgrade release (are there other than super popular? haha) it might take a while to download and upgrade.
</p>

<p>
When its done, Play button appears.
</p>

<p>
Launcher offers different game version options to install, assuming you have access to these. Public or so called live version and possible beta if currently available.
