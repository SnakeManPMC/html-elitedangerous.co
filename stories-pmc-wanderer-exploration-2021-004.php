	<h2>2021-03-31 New Day of Exploration</h2>

<p>
2021-03-31T15:51:06Z New Elite day has started, I think, just slept like 5hrs 30min so guess this is a new day heh. Back in PMC Explorer cockpit, lets plot the next carrier jump again.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T16:10:02Z Reached the next jump destination, switched to economic route plotting without filtering.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T16:56:25Z Docked at Ogaihs OU-N c20-17/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrival, sold exploration data and switched to PMC Trader for tritium refueling. Donated 32t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T17:18:14Z Docked at Ogaihs PX-X c28-34/Q1L-19Z. Donated 112t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T17:39:15Z Docked at Dryeae Froa WB-O c6-5/Q1L-19Z. Donated 110t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:00:15Z Docked at Ainaiwyg AH-S d5-144/Q1L-19Z. Donated 111t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:26:15Z Docked at Ainaiwyg HZ-M d8-84/Q1L-19Z. Donated 111t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:39:47Z I was sitting in carrier management window waiting for timer countdown to a jump while NVIDIA driver crashed and made elite unusable, it was black screen. Elite was running on the background I could hear sounds etc. So I had to kill it from task manager.
</p>

<p>
As a remainder; NO other game does this for PMC Gaming computer, its just elite. No idea why, guess its the most GPU intensive program I run but still it baffles me how it does this across different nvidia driver versions. Edit: 2022-01-16T15:53:00Z, this is caused by faulty GPU, my Nvidia GTX TITAN X (2015 model) is breaking down or has always been broken hard to say. Nvidia drivers crash also constantly much more than in elite when I'm playing <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org" target="_blank">Farming Simulator 22</a> which is directx 12 win10 requiring game.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:46:40Z Elite restarted back up.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T18:46:30Z Docked at Dryua Priae VL-S b51-6/Q1L-19Z. Donated 111t of tritium to fuel depot.
</p>

<p>
I am really bored again, will switch to exploration mode after this current jump. We are 8 jumps (9 if you count current one) away from the destination and if you recall the destination is just general area, I might even end this part of the journey bit sooner or on some other interesting system nearby.
</p>

<p>
This journey will definitely have a definite end, it began with tritium loading to carrier and ends by carrier reaching the selected destination area. After that... I have no idea, no plan whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Only idea I have is that my hands are tied with tritium fuel, I will not never ever mine it to fly my carrier somewhere, it has to be bought from a station in 790t loads. Mining 100t of tritium takes roughly one hour, so its 7-8 hours to get full lakon type-9 load and nice even 10 hours for one carrier tritium depot full. This is so much grind that as said many times by now I will never ever do it again.
</p>

<p>
Obviously this reduces our carrier range a lot, we can reach galaxy core and back to the bubble with one full cargo hold of tritium, I have not calculated the actual location in galaxy map where you can do round trip without cargo refueling from station. Does colonia work as refuel point, I don't know, I've heard random chatter that its not a really good refueling location.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T19:08:14Z Docked at Hypoea Flyiae JX-A d1-62/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Filled PMC Wanderer tritium depot to full 1000t. Then switched to PMC Explorer, plotted next carrier jump and then went to explore.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T20:22:15Z arrived at Wembia KQ-G c13-5 system, this is on Outer Arm sector which is my first time here <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:11:37Z Found tritium overlapping hotspot, yellow on yellow at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1 4 ring.
</p>

<p>
This is quite decent find, so far out here in "north west" on galaxy plane, definitely worth to prospect what kind of percentages this gives.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-31 Arriving to Our Destination</h2>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:22:24Z arrived at Phae Flaae OO-Z d13-35 system. This is now the destination system of PMC Wanderer exploration journey (as said just general area or anchor if you will). PMC Wanderer is still two jumps away from here, this is discovered system with icy rings, but I'm going to try to find suitable system for PMC Wanderer to park, you know undiscovered etc.
</p>

<p>
Actually to think of it... why not that tritium overlapping hotspot system, I mean what better place to park especially as its only one jump away (roughly) from the initial destination anchor.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:31:20Z Decided to park PMC Wanderer next to tritium double overlapping hotspot, it just simply makes sense.
</p>

<p>
It was 406ly jump from current location and as said only another 600ly away from the original destination anchor point, it makes perfect sense to park it next to this tritium overlapping hotspot. Hell I couldn't have scripted this better, huge journey here and then I find such location right next to my destination heh, just awesome <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Cant wait to try out mining it, yes I know I know you buy tritium not mine it, but surely if you find awesome location its great for recreational tritium mining. At least it gives nice break from all the exploring.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T21:48:41Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer has arrived, docked and sold exploration data.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer tritium depot 241t and cargo tritium 16133t.
</p>

<p>
My plan is not to mine tritium in order to get more fuel for PMC Wanderer, but just to see how "profitable" that double overlapping hotspot is.
</p>

<p>
Switched to PMC Miner 3 which is sub-surface deposit and laser mining python.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:05:16Z Forgot to write down but couple of minutes ago dropped to the ring and started mining tritium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:17:06Z After mining few asteroids... I unfortunately have to say I'm not impressed. I found so far no sub-surface deposits worth to mine (found one) and general percentages have been max 15% but I found one 29% with material content high. So dunno.
</p>

<p>
And now... I'm starving, I have to take a lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T22:37:35Z Feeding time over, back to tritium mining.
</p>

<p>
Timings in this first run wont reflect reality like in how long will it take to get 100t mined etc. But we'll do another run unless this first one is really bad.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T23:58:50Z Cargo and refinery bins are full, heading back to the carrier.
</p>

	<h2>2021-04-01 First Mining Trip Aftermath</h2>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:01:40Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Was trying to donate tritium to fuel depot when I got transaction error heh. When I logged back on the 224t tritium donation did go through, however the 8 or some tons in refinery bins... are now stuck there, they wont get processed. I have to assume they process the next time I go to mining and vent one, collect it and then ... dunno, weird situation heh.
</p>

<p>
Once I took one tritium ton from carriers cargo into pythons cargo, then refinery processing activated and 8t of tritium appeared. I donated those to carriers tritium depot, 473t is the current status.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:09:07Z Decided to call it a night as while I'm not tired or even exhausted yet... I would sure be if I'd go do that second tritium mining test run.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T00:09:44Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 84 traveled distance: 4219.79Ly, stations visited: 10, special planets ammonia: 1, water: 3, planets smallest: 380.528km, largest: 77445.5km, detail surface scans: 537
</p>

<p>
Overall the first mining run was laser mining, only in the end I found few sub-surface deposit asteroids. If we subtract the lunch break time... this was like what, about 1h 40min of mining to get 224t + 8t python full of tritium?
</p>

<p>
Hmm, I'll do another uninterrupted run tomorrow for first 100t and then the python's full cargo, then we get to compare numbers.
</p>

<p>
Overall I must say... nothing's changed, you WILL buy tritium from stations, its unbearable grind to mine it, just don't do it man.
