<p>
2018-12-20T00:00:57Z arrived at Vegnio ZD-K d8-127 system which had, get this, ringed water world of 21,653km radius AND ringed earth like world! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I decided to surface map all the terraformables in this system, it was fairly large system so didn't want to commit to surface map everything. Unless I'm mistaken this is only the second ringed earth like world and the water world is one of the largest I have discovered. Edit: it was just the next ELW waypoint that had ringed one as well, was this the first one I mentioned or am I forgetting all the discoveries already hehe.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T01:14:36Z arrived at Sphuqia YL-L c21-6 system, felt really tired like didn't get enough sleep last night so decided to take a nap (and shut down PMC Gaming computer).
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 121, special planets ammonia: 2, earthlike: 1, water: 12, planets smallest: 471.1km, largest: 76323.9km, detail surface scans: 543.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T07:04:10Z oops forgot to write down when I woke up from nap and continued playing, but this time had to shut elite down due usual thursday morning background simulation server update.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T07:25:08Z arrived at Hypua Groa SU-V d3-117 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 12,511ly away, 209 jumps with good filtering.
</p>

<p>
Today I was thinking that this dec 7th started exploration journey without a purpose was again meant to be just relaxing exploration which turned into something else (re-visit ELW's) so dunno what to say anymore as it always seems to happen heh. Right now I'm again thinking that "when this journey is over then I'm going out to explore just to FSS every system body and not be hurry to get anywhere specic" hehe.
</p>

<p>
Yeah I would like to FSS everything, to be thorough, but if you look at my current planned route... it would take months and months to complete as whole system FSS takes so long time and there are thousands of systems to go through.
</p>

<p>
Also I already worry that for example the drymans point codex reported earth like world will be stolen by some CMDR before I get to sell my data, I am really surprised nobody has done it yet, just checked nervously, still undiscovered.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T08:31:19Z was in Oushaist VO-T c6-1 system, finished scanning ammonia world... and I was bored, had to stop playing because it was a struggle. Time to watch some TV until I feel the urge to play elite again, I would assume this could be as earliest as later today but perhaps tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 48, special planets ammonia: 2, earthlike: 1, water: 4, planets smallest: 396.506km, largest: 76923.5km, detail surface scans: 528.
