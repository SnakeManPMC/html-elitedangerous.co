<p>
<a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a> and exploration, should you keep EDDN sending client software running while exploring?
</p>

<p>
Is it okay to keep <a href="edmc.php">EDMC</a> (or other EDDN sender) on while exploring. Yes you should always keep EDDN sending software running, however exploration is special case because if you keep the live updating running, normal operation in EDMC for example, then all your precious discoveries is sent to the community tools and websites for everyone to see in real time.
</p>

<p>
There has been reports/stories in the community over the years that some scum bag low life CMDR's, much like griefer/ganker player killers, who will scan EDDN message stream with special scripts/software to collect all valuable discoveries like earth-like worlds, water worlds, ammonia worlds, terraformables etc, then race over to the system in hopes that they can quickly scan it and sell the exploration scan data before you do, therefore "stealing your discoveries" basically.
</p>

<p>
You can prevent this "discovery theft" by making sure EDMC option is ticked, its "<b>Delay sending data until docked</b>", this way EDMC does NOT send any data to EDDN while you are out in the black exploring, but waits until you return to populated space and dock to a starport/outpost station or even for a fleet carrier. 
</p>

<p>
To protect your exploration discoveries keep that option enabled/ticked, do not dock into community CMDR's fleet carriers in the black just for fun unless there are universal cartographics available where you can sell your exploration discovery data immediately, then once you return to the bubble and dock to a station, go to universal cartographics and sell your exploration data immediately so no potential thief scumbag have time to do their deed.
</p>

<p>
Its worth to mention that exploration discovery data theft if very rare, so you might think that its no big deal to keep EDDN sending features on while exploring, but there is no benefit to anyone in the community to receive this data live instead of waiting until you return to the nearest station.
