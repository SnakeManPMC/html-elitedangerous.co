<p>2015-11-16T00:25:51Z: End of the day was Deadly 0% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-16T21:43:59Z: for accidentally shooting and killing CLEAN ship I had 7 days 6000cr bounty. It was purely accident; I proceeded for my kill just as I normally do, targeted ship that others were shooting in the hazardous RES, the ship was very low on hull percentage so I had to act quickly, but once I opened fire I noticed the warning in top right of the cockpit panel that I got fine for shooting a clean ship. Before I could react the combined fire from my ship and other (wanted heh) ships destroyed the clean ship and I got 6000cr bounty for murder.</p>

<p>So now I started my new day of RES combat in Kaushpoos but oddly there was wing of police ships which scanned me and started attacked so I had to jump out. That is new, never seen police in haz-res before, must be some community goal thing, dunno.</p>

<p>The community goal was still running for 2 days and 17 hours but I had the bounty which limited my activity creatly (for example no open play because of CMDR's shooting at me), I decided now that I'll go to neville horizons, purchase hauler, outfit it to max jump range, then go claim my bounty vouchers in LTT 2667 system as well as in all federation, empire and alliance. After that I let police (or anyone) to scan and kill me so I can get rid of the bounty.</p>

<p>Yeah I know lot of effort for small accident, although perhaps the MURDERED clean ship CMDR doesnt think so, heh. But I just want to benefit for the free haz-res activity in this community goal as its almost three days worth of bounty hunting.</p>

<p>Did all that, went through the systems that I had open bounty claim vouchers, cashed them in, then returned to Neville Horizons and stripped last remaining modules from the taxi hauler. Went outside, let police scan me after which they attacked and killed me. Bounty cleared, I'm good to go <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-11-17T09:01:59Z: End of the day was Deadly 2% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-17T20:57:48Z: aand got another murder bounty 6000cr on my head, this time absolutely without reason as in middle of the fight I had wanted ship targeted by my turrets but clean lakon type-9 mining ship flew through my laser fire, then lateron that ship was destroyed by wanted ships... and I got murder bounty... for doing absolutely nothing. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>Oh well now I'm not bothering to go through all that suicide by cop routine, I'll just fight my way through this bounty as wanted CMDR.</p>

<p>2015-11-18T08:20:07Z: End of the day was Deadly 6% rank.</p>

<p>Today Kaushpoos bounty hunting community goal finished, I was in top 5 percent with 28,4 million in bounties collected. I went to outfit fixed multi-cannons along with normal turreted beam lasers to my anaconda in Jameson Memorial, then headed out to Cerni system for some 20 percent passive bonus for bounties.</p>

<p>Had one bounty hunting session with CMDR COL.Blair which was nice.</p>
