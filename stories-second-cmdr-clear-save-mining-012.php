	<h2>2020-07-11 Murderous LTD Loads</h2>

<p>
2020-07-11T05:42:55Z New Elite day has started.
</p>

<p>
We are now going to do mining hardcore style until wednesday 15th when fleet carriers patch 3 will be released which surely will fix the self launched fighter exploit and "The Egg" craziness. I am going to mine every day as many hours as I can, trying to use both accounts as well, maybe switch between The Egg farming if it goes into that 2hrs timeout/cooldown thing.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T05:45:01Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear had no EDDN updates for hmm several hours so it dropped out of inara best sell list, now I updated it so its back in there.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T05:48:58Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer demand down to 992t, carrier cargo LTDs 15,677t cool. It wont be long now until we are ready to send her to selling system which currently is (unfortunately) Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5/Rix Depot.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T06:19:51Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer now has 827t demand left, wondered if I could have added some more, but no... it was maxed out and surely would have activated the sell bug if I added more.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T06:30:04Z Started mining, dropped into the ring.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T08:20:20Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear LTD buy order has been fulfilled. Someone reported that in system chat so I came to check. Too bad I cant run two clients at the same time so I could check in real time. Well "cant" I mean havent tried it but I cant imagine its being possible even if the second one would run in 1080p details low preset.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T08:24:58Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer LTD buy order has been fulfilled, I knew this already from carrier management when mining. Emptied my 450t LTD load and carrier status now 17,119t of diamonds holy moly! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T08:34:13Z Set buy order for 100t LTDs for lowest price possible, for donations to carrier ride to sell. Switched to second account and will do the same.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T08:39:43Z All done and real account booted up. Next I'm going to start Elite on PMC DevSurf to control second account from there.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T09:04:46Z Plotted course to Rix Depot nearby system for both PMC carriers. I was in cc-k a38-2 system, then jumped to carrier... except had huge server connection issues getting into super cruise, had to do hyper jump... but that went to wrong system EVEN THOUGH I SELECTED IT FROM CARRIER BOOKMARK, FUUUCK. I finally managed to dock into PMC Wanderer and lockdown was issued probably 20sec later, haha.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T09:16:12Z Docked at Pleiades Sector RO-Q b5-0/Q1L-19Z.
</p>

<p>
Created LTD sell order for 17,119t for 1.628 million/ton. For PMC PapaBear created same for 3345t supply.
</p>

<p>
Situation looked grim as I have 20,464t of LTDs to sell 362t per load, that would be sheer murder with type-9 to get done alone. My sell orders in this system... man they are not going to work, at all, I guarantee you that <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I really do not want to haul these on my own, it would be fucking ridiculous 56 loads! fifty fucking six! No way man, I fucking refuse to do that shit <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I think today will be spent watching tv, coding and just hourly updating EDDN by visiting both PMC carriers so they are listed in web sites.
</p>

<p>
EDDB did not take PMC PapaBear market price, its odd because it did take an update of some sort as the price update mentions mere minutes, but no LTDs show up in it, on inara both carriers show up fine.
</p>

<p>
Felt very frustrated, I knew that if I want to get these LTDs sold I need to do it myself, but man 56 loads is fucking insanity.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T10:09:13Z Arrived to Rix Depot, system chat was completely DEAD, nobody said nothing. So its pretty sure there are no traders in the system, even if I put up some silly good prices for them there are nobody to take that offer. Looks like I need to haul all the fucking 56 loads by myself <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay I'm so depressed I'm off to sleep...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T13:35:51Z Nap is over, back in-game. Jamanu is a new high selling station, got both PMC carriers jumps plotted there, dunno which body will we orbit but hopefully it will be all good.
</p>

<p>
Jamanu/Stefansson Orbital buys LTDs for 1,648,986 and has 2,458 demand which means we can haul 614.5 tons at once.
</p>

<p>
Added PMC carrier LTD sales adverts to discord, worked out issue with PMC PapaBear on EDCD #eddb channel, all good.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T16:37:48Z Started to buy from PMC Wanderer and sell to stefansson orbital, carrier inventory transfer is not working so yeah. Oh well this is going to take a long time and I will not write play-by-plays as they just cause more stress to the trading runs. So I'll just write down if something significant happens during hauling.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T19:15:37Z Was hauling diamonds having CMDR Snake Man PMC as my multi-crew, because there was a odd inventory bug I had to buy diamonds from myself so the selling profits in multi-crew were very low.
</p>

<p>
I got quite a bit of idiotic comments on system chat about PMC carrier prices, trading from PMC gets you 20,000 credit per ton profits, which is awesome for trading, but because some stupid CMDR's are offering sick 200k/ton profits, of course the idiots make retard comments about lower profits.
</p>

<p>
This low profits for traders mean that nobody trades on our carriers, I was so exhausted by the idea of hauling fucking 20,000 tons by myself that didn't even keep track but I assume nobody bought any.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that because the previous days 14.3k ton hauling was utter torture and now I'm repeating basically the same thing... I really need to either stop or start to pay more in col 285 rings and sell less in the highest selling station to get good bulk trading going on with nice volume of buy/sell action. While it is great to buy with 1.348 million and haul yourself to sell in the station at 1.648 million... it is just way too much work, it takes basically a day in each end, optimal scenario would be mere hours in each end so you could do at least one full trade loop from rings to selling station.
</p>

<p>
Guess I have to re-calculate my profit plans to get more active stuff going, I am not going to fucking repeat same shit tomorrow, I am fucking done.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T21:41:45Z Lunch break in progress...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T21:52:47Z Feeding time over, lets get back to hauling. Oh right I just realized I haven't actually specifically mentioned how I advertise PMC carriers in system chat, so here is my selling station copy-paste list:
</p>

<pre>
selling LTDs for 1,628,628 cr/ton, supply 11,229t. PMC Wanderer at star.
selling LTDs for 1,628,628 cr/ton, supply 3,345t. PMC PapaBear at star.
selling LTDs for 1,628,628 cr/ton, high supply. PMC PapaBear and PMC Wanderer.
</pre>

<p>
As said, the profit is 20k/ton from that price and it will get a fair bit of flak from the idiots in system chat. You aren't winning any hearts and minds with those prices that is for sure.
</p>

<p>
However the question is... if you want to be a wealthy business man, you cannot be everyones friend, you have to be bitch to be rich, or how did the saying go. If I start to run my carriers as charity... what fucking sense would that make? Anyways.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T22:54:11Z Another lunch break was over. Someone asked if anyone needs trucking service, so a trader offered his services, but I didn't feel like replying with PMC carrier prices because I was so angry/disappointed to this selling day that my mood was just not there, I just angrily traded this mountain of diamonds all by myself not giving a fuck what other CMDR's are doing. I really didn't like this situation at all, I much rather would take the happy "o7 greetings cmdr" mood.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-11T23:20:14Z PMC Wanderer is now sold out, picked up last 266t of LTDs. Small victories, still have over three thousand tons on PMC PapaBear where I'm heading next to get a full 614t load for the station.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-12 Back To Triple LTD Ring</h2>

<p>
2020-07-12T00:26:10Z PMC PapaBear is now sold out (few minutes ago actually, went to toilet and stretched my legs). Now its just sending both carriers back to col 285 LTD triple rings to start this loop all over...
</p>

<p>
Hell no! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah as I said above this hauling of selling station end cargo will not stand anymore, I need to make more profit for miners and traders as I cannot do either of them anymore, I have been playing fucking non stop before fleet carriers were released, I don't want to continue this 16hrs mining/trading anymore.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T00:47:10Z Jumps plotted, PMC carriers are returning to col 285 mining.
</p>

<p>
Oh right, PMC Wanderer credit balance now is 29.874 billion <img src="images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear was like... ugh already turned off PMC DevSurf monitor and wont bother to turn it on just to check, but... 5-6 billion I think.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T01:00:20Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer has arrived, not our regular system so need to remember to make proper copy pastes for system chat heh.
</p>

<p>
Set PMC PapaBear LTD buy order for 3736t for 1.448 million per ton. Then PMC Wanderer buy order 19,829t heh. And new system chat copy paste:
</p>

<pre>
buying LTDs for 1.448 million/ton. PMC Wanderer in Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5. no "sell bug".
buying LTDs for 1.448 million/ton. PMC PapaBear in Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5. no "sell bug".
buying LTDs for 1.448 million/ton. PMC carriers in Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5. no "sell bug".
</pre>

<p>
Then posted adverts to broken limpets and fleet carriers owners club discord servers. Went back to a38-2 to system chat advertise. Chat was busy, saturday night UTC 0200hrs.
</p>

<p>
Went out for quick mining with sub-surface deposit mining python.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T03:17:44Z Had to call it a night, dead tired cant focus, more carrier action tomorrow.
