<p>2015-04-08T22:53:57Z: after sleep travel continues, not yet even close to the neutron star fields.</p>

<p>2015-04-08T23:30:09Z: arrived at Bleae Thua VN-D c27-3, only grid coord 500 up in the galactic plane.</p>

<p>2015-04-09T03:58:22Z: arrived at Traikaae KJ-O d7-0, the first neutron star in this journey. Not even close where I'm heading though.</p>

<p>Soon after noticed my Saitek X55 HOTAS K1 button is broken, decided to call into the shop and ask should I send it to warranty or not. If so, then dunno if I break out my Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS or play with keyboard and mouse instead.</p>

<p>2015-04-09T05:49:38Z: stopped for feeding break and to handle that HOTAS business. Had to ship HOTAS into repairs, tried to play using keyboard + mouse some training missions but it felt so weird heh, todays exploring momentum came to a halt.</p>

<p>2015-04-09T23:15:00Z: tried playing with Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS but holy smokes it was stiff stick, my muscles were sore after playing for 3 minutes! Not to mention I barely could destroy training basic combat sidewinder, ouch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"> I want my Saitek X55 back! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-10T04:21:01Z: did final check with Thrustmaster Warthog but its so stiff and cant get the buttons to configure like in X55 so I decided to continue playing with keyboard and mouse until X55 comes back from repairs.</p>

<p>2015-04-10T04:47:52Z: call it quits for now, I just cant get the feeling and touch back by using keyboard. I'm constantly struggling to control my ship and scared shitless that slightest mistake causes my ship to get destroyed.</p>
