	<h2>Fleet Carrier Parking By The Primary Star</h2>

<p>
When Fleet Carrier is parked by the primary star, depending on the conditions it is very easy to have your big old cargo ship like Lakon Type-9 Heavy overheat when you hyper jump away from the carrier.

<p>
Also just a visual game-play thing, it is extremely bright near the primary star, so it feels like your eyes are burning when you look at the monitor, like you'd need a sun glasses to wear while playing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_cool.gif" alt="Smiley :cool:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It is much better option to park in orbit of some planetary body, if there is such available. Remember though that big gas giants can cause some strong gravity wells which slows down <a href="super-cruise.php">super cruising</a> to a crawl speed.
