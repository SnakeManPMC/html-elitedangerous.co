	<h2>HOWTO Find Stratum Tectonicas</h2>

<p>
Exobiology Stratum Tectonicas are the most common, easy to find and profitable genus/biologicals in Elite Dangerous.
</p>

<p>
However if you just go regularly exploring, meaning wandering aimlessly around the milky way galaxy, you will find extremely few Stratum Tectonicas, you might get lucky and find a lot of them but that is highly unlikely with simply exploring without any guidance.
</p>

<p>
Solution is to use Spansh website to search for high metal content worlds with specific parameters, as stratum tectonicas grow in these worlds under specific conditions.
</p>

<p>
Then on top of that we add some voodoo magic. Odyssey was released 2021-05-17 so with Spansh website wen can search for <a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a> sent data only BEFORE that date, meaning that any search matches at least EDDN wise have not been scanned since Odyssey release and should have a first footfall available. This is not 100% sure thing because unfortunately some uneducated community CMDR's are not running EDDN sending softwares and they might have visited these systems, landed on planet and grabbed the first footfall already. However in my experience on may 2025 it is like 98% sure that those Spansh search results give you virgin first footfall stratum tectonicas.
</p>

<p>
What that odyssey release means is that Elite Dangerous had high metal content worlds with thin atmospheres since the games release in december 2014, however now with odyssey game engine changes feature was added to allow CMDR's land on thin atmospheric planets and these planets are where stratum tectonicas live. So you see, if you search for the millions, probably trillions of high metal content worlds in milky way galaxy from EDDN data before odyssey release, in theory, they should all be planets where no CMDR has yet landed, well at least no CMDR who used EDDN sending software. The closer to populated space aka the bubble you are, the more likely some of these high metal content worlds have first footfall already taken, the further out in the galaxy you go the more sure it is that they are virgin planets with first footfall still available.

	<h2>Exobiology Stratum Tectonicas Search Using Spansh</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.spansh.co.uk/bodies/search/FC12E6C0-2BDB-11F0-8A9B-8D832D47561D/1" target="_blank">Spansh high metal content worlds for stratum tectonicas search, uses example reference system from Snake Sector</a>.
</p>

<p>
In short, this binary worlds search doesn't really work: Spansh stratum tectonicas search, semi major axis set to max 0.01 <a href="https://www.spansh.co.uk/bodies/search/59505884-2BCA-11F0-A7E7-AA33A114C103/1" target="_blank">Spansh high metal content world with stratum tectonicas search parameters</a>. However this returns very few results depending on your location, also in 2025-05-08 it looked like many of the search results were already had first footfall taken, might be a simple bad luck on my side or perhaps many CMDR's are using this method on the area I was at, who knows. But overall, this search stricts results quite badly, its not recommended to use even though if you get everything working in your favor, you usually get 2 or more stratum tectonicas in one system.
