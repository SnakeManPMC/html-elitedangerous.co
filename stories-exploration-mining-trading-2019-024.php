2019-09-29T04:47:34Z new elite day has begun! Lets trade <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T04:56:15Z docked at 76 Sigma Ceti/Shaw Orbital, ready to continue trading where I left off last night. Lets see how many millions I can do today before I get bored, balance same 5.371 billion right now.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T05:38:20Z had a small break to eat days first meal after the first trade route, now lets continue trading.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T06:14:41Z docked at LTT 1349/Lundwall City after getting interdicted in previous system by federal gunship, he packed a punch, fired a missile too, got my hull to 44% status which is alarmingly low. I was lucky to escape that interdiction for sure. Damage repairs cost 74.5k which is nothing in the grand scheme of things, but yeah was scary indeed.
</p>

<p>
Shields had probably prevented most of that damage, but yeah you dont explore with shields, you dont trade with shields.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T06:34:12Z docked at Dakvar/Port Bueschel and another interdiction, this time by diamondback explorer, he spammed interdictions two times before I managed to reach the station. Shot my ship hull to 81% status (I think), repairs cost 26k credits.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T06:53:09Z docked at LTT 1349/Lundwall City, got yet another interdiction this time by elite cobra, impulse attack which fucked up my thrusters for a moment, this happened again two times and naturally he also dropped into the station before bugging out. My ship hull 34% status which was pretty bad, repairs cost 77.8k credits.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T07:09:38Z docked at Dakvar/Port Bueschel, cobra was flying out just in front of the docking corridor and we collided just a little bit, my hull was 100% but got 321cr worth of repairs heh, I bet the cobra was scratched pretty good hehe.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T08:00:45Z docked at LTT 1349/Lundwall City and someone collided with me from behind in the docking corridor, I got no hull percentage damage but just 204cr repairs, no idea who it was.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T08:17:43Z got bored, heh had to take a small breather just to gather some motivation to continue. I'm thinking of maybe mining or even bounty hunting which has been on my mind more like a long term goal to try out. Dunno why I get bored so quickly, well ok today been playing now over 3hrs straight which most people don't even play in a week, so yeah...
</p>

<p>
Balance now 5.448 billion, so made so far 77 million.
