	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
My name is CMDR Snake Man and this is a story of what happened after returning to Elite after about 8 months break. I wanted to split this story in specific pages according to activity type like exploration, mining, trading, hunting missing data and bounty hunting, but it would have been such a spaghetti mess to jump back and forth between pages that a single page with continuing story through all of it is the best option.

	<h2>2019-09-08 Getting Started</h2>

<p>
Brought out Logitech/Saitek X-56 Rhino HOTAS, plugged it in and started to upgrade elite dangerous <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Started launcher but as expected, I needed to download and <a href="launcher.php">install newer launcher</a>. I did, then launched and had to log in and do the stupid email verification code dance once again.
</p>

<p>
In the launcher as expected once again, upgrade was waiting for me. It was sunday UTC 1250hrs but the upgrade went through surprisingly fast considering sundays are always the busy elite days when servers are hammered.
</p>

<p>
Did the first navigation and the second navigation docking tutorials, muscle memory needs to be refreshed <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I must say it felt magical to be back in elite sidewinder cockpit, elite is just a great space game. I can't wait to start doing something productive in the actual elite universe again after setting up <a href="edmc.php">EDMC</a> and making sure <a href="edsm.php">EDSM</a> flight logs get updated etc.
</p>

<p>
Right now I'm not sure what I want to do, I'd like to <a href="exploration.php">explore</a> but also <a href="improving-trading-data.php">hunt for the missing data (improving trading data)</a> for commodity markets. Unfortunately reason tells me that the hunt for missing data is the same old as it always was and I get frustrated/bored with it in day or two because <a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/systems/stations" target="_blank">EDSM Oldest Stations</a> and <a href="eddb.php">EDDB</a> closest missing offers nothing but endless list of planetary bases or outposts, where I would never trade with a lakon type-9.
</p>

<p>
But its still fun to travel around the populated space to see those sights, bases, outposts and space stations. Especially right now in the beginning when everything is so fresh again.
</p>

<p>
Launched EDMC and of course had long list of upgrades coming.
