	<h2>Community Goals</h2>

<p>
See official <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/community/goals/" target="_blank">elitedangerous.com community goals</a> page for the current running community goal.
</p>

<p>
If you want to take part of the community goal you have to use station services mission board to sign up for that stuff.
</p>

<p>
Now on left side panel under transactions tab and from there horizontal tab of community goals you find the current community goal, select that and you see the stats there as well, its the same info as station services but more packed together and smaller print font, making it more difficult to read, its best to check community goal info from station services missions bulletin board instead.
</p>

<p>
System chat is quite busy often times in these community goals. It was constant chime sound when new chat message arrives, so I simply had to turn system chat off.
</p>

<p>
PMCTODO this page is work in progress, if you want to help by sending new info, corrections etc, please reply to <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=23062" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum Elite Dangerous website by PMC</a> topic, thank you very much.

	<h2>Winiama</h2>

<p>
These are my research for fleet carrier parking spot for UNLOADING operations to Winima system. That system of course as being the community goal location is filled with fleet carriers just like megaship systems, you would be very lucky if you manage to grab a free slot there. Its better to simply park in some nearby system.
