	<h2>2019-09-08 Hunt For The Missing Data</h2>

<p>
Finally in the cockpit and started to go through EDSM oldest stations list.
</p>

<p>
Did like few EDSM oldest stations data hunts, but then realized that its "oldest" data, well I don't want to update oldest data because that is never ending loop, I want to add MISSING data for distance from star and market prices. So I switched to EDDB closest missing page which does return endless list of planetary shit and outposts, but at least each of these have the market prices missing, so on each docking I am actually contributing into populated place commodity markets.

2019-09-08T22:54:11Z felt ... well I'm ashamed to say but bored. I scrolled down the eddb closest missing list and it was just absolutely neverending list of planetary or outposts and I kind of got depressed. No I didn't expect to finish this today, heck not even this week heh but still I should not have scrolled down hehe. Anyways I'm just over the initial fresh excitement of populated space and honestly just elite playing. Sure I played about 11hrs straight so its not too bad and most people can't even play such sessions so I guess it was pretty good.
