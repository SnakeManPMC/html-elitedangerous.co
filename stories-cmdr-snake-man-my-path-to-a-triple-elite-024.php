<p>2015-11-28T08:22:46Z: was attacking vulture and suddenly noticed that I was wanted, err what the hell? Checked transactions and yeah, 6000cr murder bounty there for 6 days. Seriously what the hell... apparently some poor clean ship flew through my turreted beams and got hit, then later AI's killed it so I was listed amongst the killers, sucks.

<p>Was thinking oh well now I'm not going to bother to go clean this bounty off unless I start to get attacked constantly by clean ships in this beacon... Well I did, I assume thats how the fights start in hazardous RES and these beacons in the first place. So I jumped away as it leads to nothing if I have to destroy clean ships. Did the usual suicide by cop in sidewinder cheapo ship. Then back to combat rank progression.</p>

<p>Feeling very good for todays progress, I actually made a personal three day goal so that I'll reach on first day 70, second 85 and third finally 100% which is Elite rank by sunday 29th, night before Elite Horizons beta release <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-11-28T20:40:34Z: End of the day was Deadly 85% rank.</p>
