	<h2>2020-07-14</h2>

<p>
2020-07-14T13:35:56Z New Elite day has started, the last day before Fleet Carriers Patch 3 which will fix SLF exploit and overlapping hotspot goodness.
</p>

<p>
Was very disappointed about the LTD buying numbers, demand in wanderer 10,399t and papabear 2969t. This has been taking extremely long, of course PMC PapaBear went to sell in between here so yeah guess we have to say PMC Wanderer has been taking really long to buy.
</p>

<p>
In system chat several CMDR's now are advertising buy prices just above 1.5 million so that might be the cause of it, selling miners are looking "1.4 vs 1.5" and its obvious where you should sell... or is it? Remember the other carriers which were offering LESS than me but they were a "clown" in the chat (meaning bullshitting a lot, kind of like used car sales men) so stupid miners went to sell for them instead of the highest price which was PMC carriers, so yeah go figure that shit out huh.
</p>

<p>
Note: I did not discord advertise at all this time. I could be a factor, dunno.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T14:30:15Z Lunch break was over, I was by The Egg, mining starts now.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T17:11:23Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer offloaded 704t + 8t LTDs, demand now 8820t. Felt little bit exhausted from mining, I should go back out to fulfill my "we go hardcore!!1" promise, but... I just don't feel like it. Was thinking that at bare minimum I would switch to second account and mine something for him, but hmm dunno. At least I need to take a small breather, actually cooking food for a lunch break sounds very good.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T17:26:42Z Started mining... except The Egg did not re-spawn, so I just left PMC Miner 2 there so I can advertise PMC carriers and then started to cook food, its lunch time.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T18:19:07Z Lunch is over, lets switch to second account and bring its The Egg abusing setup here.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T18:24:38Z Exited Elite and shut down EDMC by unselecting the update edsm/inara settings, time to mine some with second account.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T18:44:04Z CMDR Snake Man PMC arrived at The Egg, now waiting until pirates disappear before we start to mine. I'm thinking this will be one full load from The Egg and then we are off to sell our carrier contents because... I want to be sure that all diamonds are sold by tomorrow 1000hrs when fleet carriers patch 3 servers go down and LTD mining/prices/thing wont be the same anymore.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-07-14T20:32:19Z Had enough of mining</b>, quite exhausted for MINING and just wanted to leave the annoying / offensive col 285 system chat as PMC carriers were filling up so slowly, if at all, I wanted to go sell already and be done with this. Was thinking its better to go there in good time, maybe try to haul as many loads I can before putting sell order in place if the hauling is too much for me, heck I don't even know do I have more than 20k load right now.
</p>

<p>
So I left col 285 sector cc-k a38-2 LTD triple overlapping hotspot for the last time before fleet carriers patch 3 and headed to PMC PapaBear.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T20:37:43Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear I had 338t of LTDs from this trip, was pretty blah experience I'm just too exhausted for mining and the system chat bullshit right now. Glad its finally over, well besides the selling station... dunno, if its too annoying I'll just turn it off.
</p>

<p>
Sold 338t LTDs to PMC PapaBear and the carrier demand is down to 2305 (cant even remember where it started), cargo now is absolutely pitiful 1782t LTDs and 1883t tritium, wow I didn't realize it was this bad, but then again PMC PapaBear did do extra selling trip while PMC Wanderer has been buying all this time.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T20:41:25Z Shut down Elite in PMC Gaming for CMDR Snake Man PMC for the last time in this 2020 LTD craziness.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T20:44:33Z Elite booted up with real account, also started to boot it up on PMC DevSurf for second account. PMC carriers will jump into nivati a 1 and LTD selling begins.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T20:51:09Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer LTD demand was down to 7449t which is okay-ish, I guess. Cargo has 16,303t LTDs and 198t tritium.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T20:56:06Z Increadible at first attempt got carrier slot in nivati a 1 for PMC Wanderer AND PMC PapaBear! Alright selling is about to start soon. These jumps give me good time for a small breather, maybe I muster some energy and motivation to continue that LTD selling all by myself.
</p>

<p>
Combined LTD count from both carriers is 18,085t which is really a lackluster number, I would have wanted full loads of course or at least twenty kay, but hey this is what we got, me trading hauling that alone is plenty enough work heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T21:12:20Z Docked at Nivati/Q1L-19Z. PMC carriers arrived to nivati a 1. Was thinking what should I do, just put the LTDs on sale with usual 100k or should I just try to sell them myself by using some "nobody wants to trade" amount like 20k profit.
</p>

<p>
I cannot or rather too afraid to pick the cargo up from the carriers hold myself as the damn dialog is on RED warning that too much cargo, I bet if you try to take the cargo it just magically disappears due some bug, so I rather buy the cargo from my own carrier.
</p>

<p>
Also if I put 20k price so that nobody would dip into my trading I would definitely not advertise it to anyone as that would get a lot of shit in the system chat. Probably nobody would even notice if I turned EDMC off and did not announce or dunno if inara picks the info from frontier api directly, eh anyways.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T21:24:37Z With these buggy fleet carriers looks like if I don't have any sell order I can then pick up from inventory -&gt; transfer just fine without any red dialogs, ok this is good so I'll start by selling from PMC Wanderer cargo with second account as multi-crew, this will be cool with great profits as I'm not buying the stuff from anywhere.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-14T21:34:54Z Docked at Nivati/Chamitoff Enterprise. First haul sold, got like 1.1 or so billion, CMDR Snake Man PMC in multi-crew got (unless I counted the zeroes wrong) 56 million trade dividends <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now I'm continuing this selling as long as I get bored or I ran out of diamonds in PMC Wanderer. Not going to write play-by-plays but just mention if something significant happens.
</p>

<p>
BTW system chat has been rather quiet now, couple of familiar names said few words about trading and giving 150k per ton profits for traders, thats why I'm not going anywhere near that with some 20k profit deals.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-15 Selling My Last Diamonds</h2>

<p>
2020-07-15T00:18:49Z Feeling good, not exhausted or bored, was watching some youtube music video on the side while trading, system chat was very very quiet but everytime there was something going on I read it of course, overall was just happy mood while haulin' some diamonds for 1.1 billion per load.
</p>

<p>
Lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T00:46:32Z Feeding time is over, now we finish this 2020 LTD mining craziness...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T03:51:41Z Docked at Nivati/Q1L-19Z. Finished hauling LTDs from PMC Wanderer and PMC PapaBear with CMDR Snake Man PMC as my multi-crew member <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>2020 Low Temperature Diamond craziness is finally over!</b> No more! Good bye mining in this context! No more re-spawning "<a href="egg.php">The Egg</a>"! heh, aah feels good <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T04:06:22Z Plotted jumps back to col 285 LTD triple rings for PMC carriers. Yeah I'm not planning on going mining, hell no, but after the patch I want to go check to see how badly FDEV tweaked the triple overlapping hotspots for LTDs and how much single hotspots were buffed. Also... I don't know what else to do and I want to vacate nivati a 1 so other carriers can jump there to sell cargo.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T04:21:22Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. Both PMC carriers arrived. I think now I'm going to take a nap before UTC 1000hrs when fleet carrires patch 3 servers go down, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-15T04:28:04Z Shut Elite down, going to sleep a bit before patch 3 release.
