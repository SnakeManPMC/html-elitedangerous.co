<p>
Example of planet with atmosphere which is non land-able, you pick these out easily from the <a href="system-map.php">system map</a> with the blue sphere around it, but unless it has the blue half circle, then you cannot land to it.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea why this atmosphere is designated with that blue circle/sphere as you cant land on those, unless they are also land-able, which this example images one is not.
