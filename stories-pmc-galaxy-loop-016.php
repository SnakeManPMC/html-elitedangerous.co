<p>2017-10-18T00:12:35Z arrived at Hachaei WP-W c15-1 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 08.
</p>

<p>It is amazing that after almost a year off from elite I sort of started to get bored with exploration jumping again as I soon started to use normal fastest route plotting with that 51.66ly jump range. I wasn't in hurry, but still didn't feel like nudging around in economical plotting which is super slow traveling. Also when I made few ammonia / earth like / water world discoveries, I didn't go near them or screenshot them which I usually do. Honestly when you've seen one earth like, you've seen them all. Not complaining, just telling you how it is...
</p>

<p>2017-10-27T07:02:58Z took a few days break but now was back in cockpit, plotted 13k ly route to PMC Galaxy Loop leg 09.
</p>

<p>2017-10-29T07:22:36Z arrived at Drootie SF-C d14-70 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 09.
</p>

<p>Tried to set course to Beagle Point at 12k ly away but route plotting failed. So plotted next hop about 5k ly away instead.
</p>

<p>2017-10-29T11:00:37Z at Choi Eork SE-Y c17-1 system I found had other CMDR discovered water worlds the first time in thousands of light years. Man, I'm getting closer to Beagle Point...
</p>

<p>Cheia Eohn VZ-O e6-0 another system, well a star, discovered by other CMDR, also the next system I jumped. Damn, lot of commanders traveled through here heh.
</p>

<p>At 6100ly from Beagle Point I started to find a lot of stars discovered by other CMDR's.
