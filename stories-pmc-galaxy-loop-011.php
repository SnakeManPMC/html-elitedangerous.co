<p>2016-10-31T00:00:09Z heh wow almost 0000 UTC heh. Decided that I'm doing the detour to Colonia. Eraktor is unknown status at this time but I still want to visit Colonia, so off we go. Nice 32,000Ly detour <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>So its one way 16,380Ly to be precise. I'm planning on returning from this detour back where I am now.
</p>

<p>2016-11-01T23:34:27Z okay so 2016-10-31 I tested out some neutron star jetcone boosts, it was bit scary as I already have not huge but a lot of exploration data with me so getting ship destroyed by some foolishness like neutron star boosting would not be a great idea.
</p>

<p>I managed quite easily in fact to boost I believe three times. When I jumped into fourth neutron star system I got disconnected from Elite servers, well okay I thought and logged back in... uh oh! entering the game / server my ship was on the neutron star jetcone and taking damage! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I knew beforehand that this is a no win situation, CMDR Eraktor had his ship destroyed by the exact same thing, so I immediately logged off and submitted support ticket about this issue.
</p>

<p>Well today support answered and they had repaired my ship and moved it to nearby non neutron star system, yes! Thank you Frontier Support! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I was in Eorgh Pre GA-J a36-1 system and get back on my travel towards Colonia.
