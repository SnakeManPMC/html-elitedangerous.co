	<h1>Colonization Loading System Distance PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
Colonization Loading System Distance. What is loading system? It refers to star system where you load colonization required commodities to a fleet carrier. Its about fleet carrier cargo loading, either the carrier owner loading the carrier alone or offers community CMDR's opportunity to make good profits by creating buy order for the fleet carrier with high profit, this is the "loading [star] system" in Elite Dangerous.

	<h2>Colonization Loading System Distance</h2>

<p>
Meaning when you send your fleet carriers to load system colonization required commodities round trip, you have to make sure the loading system is closer than 500LY because it is a big NO NO if you have to hyper space jump your carriers two times, its just unnecessary.

This is written in 2025-04-11T03:26:50Z which is only less than two months since Elite Dangerous v4.1 trailblazers update release date, community CMDR's have been busy expanding the human population, aka the bubble, to all directions, especially towards the galaxy core (center). Right now I am colonizing Snake Sector and my current system being constructed is <b>Snake Sector FB-X c1-12</b>, this is 594.14LY distance from LHS 6309 system where PMC carriers were being loaded. In time when the bubble expands more, when the hard working trailblazer CMDR's get further and further from the original "the bubble", this issue becomes more and more problematic/frequent.
</p>

<p>
Eventually these colonized systems get more constructions done, facilities build, coriolis, orbis, ocellus etc starports and big surface ports which produce commodities like CMM composite, steel, titanium, liquid oxygen etc, so hopefully in the near future, if not already today, there are colonized systems out there with these starports and surface ports to provide raw materials to purchase for the leading edge of trailblazing CMDR's pushing further and further towards the galaxy core and otherwise expanding the bubble. Community will not be tied down to the bubble center mass forever.
</p>

<p>
However as of today, tomorrow and the near future, please make sure when you send your fleet carriers to a loading system that it is within one hyper space jump distance. If you supposedly cannot find such system within 500LY range, then search harder, there surely are some within that distance, even if its the newly colonized systems.
</p>

<p>
I can tell you from personal experience that it is extremely frustrating to hyper space jump one let alone several fleet carriers more than once in a round trip to pickup required commodities.
