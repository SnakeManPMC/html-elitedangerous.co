	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Story about CMDR Snake Man PMC second account <i>second</i> fleet carrier <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This story also is a historical record of the 2020 Low Temperature Diamonds (LTD) era crazyness when commanders were making billion credits a day. That was fun.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I cleared save on second account CMDR Snake Man PMC. Today my goal is to start with a sidewinder and mine myself up to fleet carrier, resurrection of PMC PapaBear here we go! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-29 Second Beginning</h2>

<p>
2020-06-29T20:46:10Z Started playing, a lot of new player nonsense to go through heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T21:27:59Z Shot some ships, got bounty vouches, had enough for an mining ship upgrade.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T21:48:11Z Docked at Ye'kuape/Bobko Hub. Sidewinder upgraded with mining outfitting. Now begins the long journey to Col 285 LTD triple overlapping hotspot system <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T22:55:32Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2/G4Q-14Z. Finally traveled all the way to col 285 LTD triple system, it was a struggle in that almost stock sidewinder, had to stop and buy a fuel scoop to complete the journey. Arrived and docked with phat's ltd shop carrier which is the first one in system map orbiting body 1.
</p>

<p>
I noticed a mistake on my outfitting, forgot to buy detailed surface scanner even though it was listed in edsy.org plan.
</p>

<p>
Finally found the DSS and then off to mine. Man it was eye opening experience to mine with such newbie equipment. Got whopping 4 LTD's mined before I ran out of limpets, then it was off to search for departing carrier.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-30 Sidewinder Mining</h2>

<p>
2020-06-30T00:22:41Z Docked at Col 285 Sector HI-I a39-3/JNF-95Q. Found one carrier announcing in system chat, docked ok, there was no route set as of yet but I was glad to be on board with my precious first LTD cargo <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This will get us started, although I believe I need to make one more run with PMC Starter 2 sidewinder, we'll see after these 4 LTDs are sold.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T00:34:39Z This carrier I docked on was a bust, the owning CMDR was nowhere to be seen, I left to search for another carrier.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T00:55:03Z Went back to mining and finished, 7t LTDs in cargo, out of limpets, now lets find a carrier.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T01:10:07Z Docked at Col 285 Sector JT-H c10-3/KFV-18W. Boaty McBoatface, it announced departure but when I docked the countdown hadn't even started yet, shiet man this is repeat of the previous carrier.
</p>

<p>
Carriers CMDR was not even in the system when I docked, still at 0122hrs he was docking and refueling, really slow and tedius delays. If you announce your carrier is leaving you better be ready to leave.
</p>

<p>
Man why is this mining getting started so slow, I had the initial 4t of cargo done like damn hour ago <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Docked, sold 7 LTDs for 1.1m something, didn't check was in a hurry to get back to the carrier heh. When I got back to the carrier docking was denied, so I went to...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T01:51:15Z Docked at Neto/H8X-0VZ. Which is Bwanaboat, that <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bwana" target="_blank">Bwana twitch streamer dude</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T02:20:58Z Done mining, again 7t LTDs in cargo, that was fast! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now begins the ever lasting hunt for the next departing carrier...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T02:25:30Z Docked at Col 285 Sector TZ-P d5-68/H8X-0VZ. Again got a ride in Bwanaboat, nice. This mining trip will be probably the fastest in the history of mining, I mean look at those times heh I spent like few minutes mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Credits now 8.604 million, so after the next sell I'm easily going to upgrade into next better mining ship and we can start to make some real credits. Hmm actually the cobra upgrade costs 6.7 million so I already had that kind of credits since the last sell, oh well, now I have more <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T02:34:02Z Docked at Neto/Ising Vision. Sold 7t LTDs for 8.1 million, credits now 16.720 million. Okay now we are going to upgrade into cobra mk3 <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-30 Cobra Mk 3 Mining</h2>

<p>
2020-06-30T02:51:31Z Purchased and outfitted Cobra MK3 ! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T02:56:03Z Docked at Neto/H8X-0VZ. Bwanaboat again heh, this carrier is becoming my regular ride <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh btw felt SO GOOD to fly Cobra Mk3 once again, what an awesome ship with so much nostalgia coming with it from original Elite 1984.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T03:24:37Z Got blown up by pirates, was too eager to get to mining and didn't notice they didn't come to scan me yet and then with all the usual system chat bullshit going on I missed what they said in comms, they opened fire and I was dead before I managed to hit boost button.
</p>

<p>
Oh well re-buy into Bwanaboat, lets now go buy that pulse wave analyzer as well and try again.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T03:34:57Z Docked at Neto/Ising Vision. Outfitted pulse wave analyzer, rearmed and bought cargo hold full of limpets.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T03:39:18Z Docked at Neto/H8X-0VZ.
</p>

<p>
Alright now we are heading back to LTD triple rings for some mining with everything in order and this time I'll watch out for pirates as well heh. Now we are going to start to make some credits. Got fifty two tons cargo capacity and few in the refinery bins so hopefully will be a nice load to sell and takes no time to mine it.
</p>

<p>
Cobra Mk3 with only one 1A collector limpet controller is atrociously slow to collect stuff <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T04:34:27Z All done, 52t in cargo and refinery bins full <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T04:36:06Z Docked at Col 285 Sector TZ-P d5-68/H8X-0VZ. Bwanaboat was scheduled to leave and I just made it, heh awesome. Was watching Bwana's twitch stream and hurried up when he spoke about plotting a route heh.
</p>

<p>
Cobra Mk3 gets full from single asteroid in sub surface deposits when there are 4 of them, heck I didn't even drill more than 2 I think and had to leave tons of fragments behind. Awesome stuff.
</p>

<p>
Now only question is... how long until we get to upgrade into sub surface/laser mining python with 224t cargo capacity. Anyways lets not get ahead of ourselves and still keep eye on cobra mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T04:50:13Z Docked at Neto/Ising Vision. Sold 52t of LTDs for 60.2 million, then refinery bins processed 6 more and sold those for 6 million something, credits now 76.914 million. Making credz baby <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After the next load we get to purchase python, man this LTD mining pays crazy amounts heh. But then again fleet carriers upkeep costs money, maybe this is working exactly as FDEV designed it, carrier owners must mine to maintain the super high costs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T04:56:27Z Docked at Neto/H8X-0VZ. Bwanaboat, got in again and this time looks like CMDR Bwana hasn't even plotted a route yet. Actually it took me no time to go sell my LTD load so.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T06:03:39Z All done, cargo hold 52t of LTDs and refinery bins almost full, one empty I think. Oddly enough I missed a lot because the asteroid got depleted as well.
</p>

<p>
Alright lets go find a carrier and make some credits <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T06:28:12Z Docked at Neto/Ising Vision. Sold 52t of LTDs for 60.2 million, then 4 more were processed by refinery and sold those for 4.6 million, credits now 141.841 million.
</p>

<p>
I think its time to buy a python <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-30 Python and Elite Dangerous v3.7 Patch 2</h2>

<p>
2020-06-30T06:38:13Z Docked at G 139-50/Filipchenko City. Purchased python and sub surface/laser mining outfitted it, got 224t cargo capacity.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T09:41:25Z Was mining (forgot to write it down, heh) when Elite patch announcement came on. Closed Elite down just before the galaxy servers were about to go down. Good break and we see what they did to fix carriers and tweak mining, at least the ship launched fighter asteroid respawn exploit will be gone.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-06-30T10:11:09Z Elite Dangerous v3.7 Fleet Carriers Patch 2 upgraded</b>, back in-game. Lets continue.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T10:40:30Z Docked at Neto/Ising Vision. Sold 140t of LTDs for 162.3 million, credits now 207.9 million.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at edsy.org for a Lakon Type-9 sub surface deposit mining and I could easily affort it now fully outfitted, however I'm going to do one more mining session with python as I haven't done any yet (the patch stopped me).
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T12:39:18Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-2/N1G-0TZ. Axis Trade was the carrier name, bought LTDs for 1.2 million per ton, I sold 163t for 197.3 million, credits now 405 million <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
?UTC Finished mining, quite exhausted. Searched around for someone to buy my diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T14:53:17Z Sold 203t LTDs in some carrier for 1.251 million per ton. Had to sell them in several batches as it would not accept whole load at once. Credits now 659 million <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-30T14:54:43Z Been up dunno how many hours as my 16hrs timer went off like hours ago hehe, gotta get some sleep, Resurrection of PMC PapaBear continues tomorrow.
