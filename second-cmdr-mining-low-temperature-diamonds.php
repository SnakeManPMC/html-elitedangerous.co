	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Had an crazy idea that I'm going to <a href="multiple-accounts.php">switch to second account</a> and start <a href="mining.php">Low Temperature Diamond (LTD) mining</a> grind for credits to buy a Fleet Carrier <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
My second account CMDR "Snake Man PMC" had Lakon Type-7 from previous <a href="from-scratch-trading.php">Start From Scratch Trading</a> adventure. Plan was to mine LTDs and get a ride to best selling station from Fleet Carriers which taxi miners around.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-14</h2>

<p>
2020-06-14T15:51:53Z CMDR Snake Man PMC was in-game, lets start grinding some credits <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Outfitted lakon type-7 with mining lasers, refinery, prospector/collector limpet controller and detailed surface scanner. I think my credit balance was somewhere around 90-94 million credits, not sure (would need to check journals).
</p>

<p>
Checked VicTics miners tool, Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2 is now the new LTD triple overlapping hotspot. Set my course there and off I go.
</p>

<p>
Lasers hit first ice cube about 1645hrs UTC.
</p>

<p>
I don't have any CMDR diary text for this but there are a lot of youtube videos for this mining. Check out PMC elite dangerous youtube playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAHjd0gRPyg&list=PLKt0kt4BAefkf_dCsdlj3nSrvgwA0KssM&index=110" target="_blank">Low Temperature Diamonds Mining (2nd Account) Part 1, 2020-06-14</a> for details.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-15</h2>

<p>
2020-06-15T0220 was dead tired after playing all this time. Did some sub surface deposit mining, latest sell was 300 million something, final credit balance 685 million heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15 Woke up and straight to mining. Did first 224t load of LTDs very easily. It was done 1005hrs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T11:01:17Z sold my first load 211t and budget now 927.3m
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T11:27:15Z arrived second time to the ring, fired first prospector limpet.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T12:17:23Z cargo hold full, refinery bins full. HOOYAH!
</p>

<p>
We have new best selling station Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Not sure what happened to the previous LHS 154a/Fung Station best sell, guess there was some daily background simulation tick, dunno. I'm using <a href="tradedangerous.php">TradeDangerous</a> to get LTD market prices.

<p>
2020-06-15T12:43:57Z arrived at Lu Pao system and docked, sold 224t LTDs for 385.3m, budget now 1.312 billion! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T12:50:00Z docked at Endar Spire, CMDR RevanUST's carrier, its departing to LTD ring in 1300hrs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T14:05:19Z cargo hold at 220t of LTDs, lets go find a ride for us <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Didn't find a carrier right away so took a short lunch break and shut elite down.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T14:55:57Z elite back up, lets find that carrier...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T15:44:00Z docked at Feyonman L00-G8L, finally found a carrier scheduled to go Lu Pao system.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T15:55:56Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 220t of LTDs for 378.4m, budget now 1.691 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T16:10:42Z Docked at HR 6421/Serebrov Terminal.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-15 Upgrade To Lakon Type-9 HEAVY</h2>

<p>
2020-06-15T16:12:11Z purchased Lakon Type-9 Heavy. Started to outfit it for sub surface deposit mining. <a href="https://is.gd/YqYsSg" target="_blank">edsy.org Lakon Type-9 Heavy Sub Surface Deposit Mining Specifications</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T16:28:28Z departed towards LTD mining system. Arrived and docked to one of the fleet carriers to purchase limpets.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T16:58:47Z arrived to LTD ring, started prospecting... this will take a while <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T17:55:41Z had 227t of LTDs in cargo, so took considerably longer than in type-7.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T18:36:24Z ran out of sub surface deposit missiles <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Got 409t of LTDs before the missiles ran out, still 213 limpets left so I could have gone much longer mining if I had basic mining lasers.
</p>

<p>
Checked TradeDangerous LTD best sell locations which were:

<p>
2020-06-15T18:48:59Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/L30-J8Z. Shes going to Lu Pao. Not sure what kind of prices do I get from 409t load but lets hope its good.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T19:11:38Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 409t LTDs for 701.8m, credits now 2.204 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T19:36:39Z Shut down elite for lunch break <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T19:52:37Z Lunch break over, elite back up and we are ready to get back to work.
</p>

<p>
Went to outfit better missile launchers, <a href="https://is.gd/J5kaJG" target="_blank">new outfitting for Lakon Type-9 sub surface deposit mining</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T20:22:17Z Dropped into LTD ring, mining continues, is this our third trip today? Now with more sub surface deposit missiles yehaaw.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T21:23:38Z Had already 246t of LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T23:10:10Z cargo hold full 640t, we're done here <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T23:27:49Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/W70-Q8H.
</p>

<p>
When docked at this carrier I felt quite exhausted, it was intensive mining session and it already has been a long day today. Felt exhausted but good, very happy that I got 640t of LTDs plus 8 or so in the refinery hoppers.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-15T23:52:48Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 640t of LTDs for 966.6m, then refinery hoppers produced 7t more, sold them for 10.5m, credits now 3.181 billion.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-16</h2>

<p>
2020-06-16T02:33:21Z Too tired had to call it a night, zzz. More mining tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T10:40:57Z New mining day has started, elite back up, in-cockpit and ready to go.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T11:03:27Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/F90-Z5Q. All Under Heaven carrier, due Lu Pao system. Need to get them diamonds sold.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T11:21:52Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 362t of LTDs for 622.7 million, credits now 3.804 billion.
</p>

<p>
Regarding time used mining I feel like type-7 is too fast and type-9 too slow, in my sub surface deposit outfitting type-7 will get cargo hold full in less than an hour, type-9 does the same in about three hours.
</p>

<p>
Selling type-9 640t load often gets the bulk tax penalty for selling price, in that sense type-7 faster mining and smaller load would be better. But dunno, its difficult to find the best balance here.
</p>

<p>
I outfitted type-7 with laser mining and 256t cargo, no shields, no fuel scoop. This will be interesting experiment, how long till its full. <a href="https://is.gd/yQkiH9" target="_blank">edsy.org Lakon Type-7 Laser Mining Specifications</a>.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:20:41Z Docked at Lu Pao/K72-W6Q. Carrier Duke of Edinburgh. Initially they had friends and squadron only but then opened docking access, odd.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:49:35Z Had arrived to the ring but needed to wait until wing of three fake scripted AI pirates disappeared.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T12:51:29Z First laser beam hit the asteroids, lets do this! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First ice cube was 30%+ and got me 9 LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T13:40:23Z First 100 LTDs done.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T13:53:51Z Cargo hold full, I got like hum 100+ limpets originally I think.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T14:54:16Z Refinery full, cargo hold 256t full. We're done here.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:03:51Z Docked at Col 285 Sector FN-J c9-15/L28-Z7Z. SS Shooting Star carrier, departing to Lu Pao system. Odd that they had no commodity market for LTD donating, oh well no payment from me then I guess (as I have no tritium).
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:32:17Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 256t of LTDs for 440.3 million, then 6 more from refinery got done and sold those for 10.3 million, credits now 4.259 billion.
</p>

<p>
I must have gone to switch back to Lakon Type-9 sub surface deposit miner ship here but forgot to write it down heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T15:50:34Z Docked at Lu Pao/W42-J8T. Boarded this carrier enroute to LTD rings.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T16:09:25Z Dropped into the LTD ring. Waiting for pirates to disappear.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T16:10:44Z First prospector limpet fired.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T17:36:12Z Cargo hold reached max capacity, 313t LTDs and 319 limpets.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:12:04Z Cargo hold full 640t and few in refinery bins. We're done here.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:35:32Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/L97-V2L. Carrier Elsie departing to Lu Pao system. Lets go sell some diamonds. Upon arrival donated (sold for 150k) one LTD for the ride.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T19:47:12Z Docked at Lu Pao/Swift Vision. Sold 639t LTDs for 966.6 million, credits now 5.226 billion.
</p>

<p>
Took a little break here to catch up video editing, discord and having lunch as well heh. Man I needed a break after all that mining haha.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T20:45:53Z Elite back up, planning on my fleet carrier purchase. Mostly about where do I buy fuel and how long with it take to haul that crap.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T20:57:47Z Docked at Lan Tzak/Jacobi Platform.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-16 PMC PapaBear Is Born</h2>

<p>
2020-06-16T21:02:40Z Purchased CMDR Snake Man PMC fleet carrier called PMC PapaBear <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Ship ID is K64-P4N
</p>

<p>
Then had to figure out best way to refuel this beast and get it into action in Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2 mining LTDs heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T22:30:17Z arrived at Col 285 Sector BH-K a38-5 system. Decided not to refuel but to jump right into mining. This was the closest system I found.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T22:51:26Z Started mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-16T23:35:13Z Elite caused my GPU nvidia driver to crash so had to exit elite to recover. This mining trip was cut short. Next time I'll start elite up pirates appear and I have to jump out.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-17 Elite Dangerous v3.7 Fleet Carriers Patch 1</h2>

<p>
2020-06-17T00:19:59Z Dropped into LTD ring.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T01:40:10Z Started to feel really exhausted and tired, been up over 16hrs straight mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T01:47:32Z Shut down elite, time to refreshen up maybe I could still squeeze in few more hours...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T02:02:19Z Had to call it a night, just way too exhausted and tired, more fleet carrier mining tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-06-17T09:50:00Z Elite servers were scheduled to go down for v3.7 fleet carriers release patch 1.</b> This included LTD sub surface deposit reduction, no more billions for miners heh, well ok not quite but yeah the lucrative days are over, no more four days from 90 million to a carrier.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T14:44:35Z Elite started. Looks like CMDR Snake Man PMC's carrier ID is now KNX-T6F.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T18:55:44Z Finished mining, yeah they definitely reduced the yields, I felt like this was taking a really long time and I only got 259t LTDs and 89t tritium. Hmm perhaps me mining tritium increased the time and feeling of it taking longer, hmm well obviously but like that much dunno.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-17T19:06:31Z Docked at PMC PapaBear and called it a night, just too hot in PMC Bunker (my apartment) +28.8C and I'm just sweating feeling extremely uncomfortable, did not have passion for mining/elite right now.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-18</h2>

<p>
2020-06-18T00:58:58Z Back in-game, at the LTD ring, lets mine some minerals.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T03:02:18Z Decided to end mining trip with 162t LTDs and 69t tritium in cargo hold. I want to go explore with my real account hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T03:14:57Z was flying towards PMC PapaBear and took a screenshot F10 while avidemux was merging video files... elite crashed heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Next gaming session will be exploration again with real account.
</p>

<p>
Apparently I didn't write down what happened in-between here, did I do some real CMDR account exploration or what, cant remember heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T14:43:35Z Back in elite, lets see if we can do some carrier taxiing CMDRs to the sell systems.
</p>

<p>
Looks like we got new LTD pricing again. Fresh outta TradeDangerous:

<p>
Started transfer of type-9 and diamondback explorer into PMC PapaBear, eta 25min.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T18:08:25Z Docked at Newman Orbital, winged up with CMDR fubber, sold 534t LTDs for 918 million but unfortunately we did not get trade dividends, it bugged out.
</p>

<p>
Haven't been keeping track but I did at least couple of carrier taxi rides for miners, got some tritium and LTDs donated. Many thanked me / PMC PapaBear for the ride and overall the atmosphere was real nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T20:29:13Z After a lunch break back in diamondback explorers cockpit onboard PMC PapaBear. Lets now keep a track of our tritium and LTD stats so we can see how much commanders donate.
</p>

<p>
Currently we have 491t tritium in the fuel tank, commodity market demand 992t tritium and 2481t LTDs. Carriers inventory has 19t LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T20:57:56Z Tritium fuel tank 455t and nobody donated any LTDs, at all. they are exactly the same numbers, wow, free ride eh?
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T21:55:22Z Tritium fuel tank 432t and nobody donated any LTDs, at all. However this is departure from LTD ring to selling station, so they might donate after we reach the destination.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T22:14:54Z Arrived at Oceliu Anat. Tiritum fuel tank 473t and commodity market demand 948t tritium and 2478t LTDs, someone donated, great.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T22:43:37Z Elite crashed on return hyperspace jump heh. When arrived tritium fuel tank 437t so someone donated, nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T23:09:34Z In Oceliu Anat, tritium fuel tank 401t and commodity demand 2476t LTDs, so two diamonds donated, nice.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-18T23:43:02Z In LTD ring end of trip again, tritium fuel tank 365t and no commodity changes as expected on return trip when miners are empty.
</p>

<p>
In general I must say that this stuff ain't paying off, not really. I mean sure I got some tritium donations but those wont even match the fuel used not to mention the cheap price they have and the LTD donations have been very few, like on this last jump mere two (2) were donated. Sure its somewhat OK credits if we compare it to tritium buy price, but yeah... I'd say its mostly running without much profit, not even close to breaking even.
</p>

<p>
At this moment I'm just about ready to stop and do something else. Well I have been playing like ten hours straight now too.
</p>

<p>
Did one more trip to Oceliu Anat.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-19</h2>

<p>
2020-06-19T01:28:35Z Called it a night, its been a long day and just don't have mental energy to continue. Actually I didn't even plan on taxiing miners today but it just happened.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T17:26:36Z New Elite day has started.
</p>

<p>
Today I decided to do some mining, not just continue the old mining but to go for the Corona Austr. Dark Region OX-U b2-3 6 which I have not checked out yet.
</p>

<p>
Took my diamondback explorer to Hirpinyi/Altshuller Gateway, checked tritium info out and yes looks like 10k supply and 44k market price, I can do that. Lets bring the carrier over here and start refueling it. Sent a call in system chat but it was dead, nobody replied.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T20:48:26Z Finished refueling some time ago already, tritium in cargo now 5,516t which is quite nice amount for populated space. Turned off tritium commodity market, nobody donated, nobody was in the system chat, it was a dead system.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T20:55:22Z Arrived at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3.
</p>

<p>
Got an another crazy idea which I wanted to develop and now I'm ending this second account mining for fleet carrier game-play here, I'm sure I'll return it one day.
