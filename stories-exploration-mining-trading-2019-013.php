Apparently somewhere here is missing CMDR log parts about second account trading start from scratch, I'll try to locate this log and insert here, but for now we skip to 17th on quick note.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-17T0145hrs when I was done start from scratch playing, I backupped journals, netlogs and elite log from CMDR "Snake Man PMC". Then deactived second and activated real account. Finally restored my real CMDR "Snake Man" Elite Log config and log files.
