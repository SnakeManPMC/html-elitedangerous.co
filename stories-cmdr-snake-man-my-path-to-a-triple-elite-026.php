	<h2>Triple Elite Thoughts</h2>

<p>The journey to three elite ranks was long and extremely tough, as you just read above I had few burnouts and the one took me good three months to get over with. Such burnouts are nothing new to me from Falcon 4 and OFP/ArmA/ArmA2 editing times.
</p>

<p>When I'm focusing on some aspect like editing or this triple elite goal, I'm doing nothing else than it. My usual triple elite journey day consisted of nothing but playing elite, only breaks were to get something to eat, rest was pure elite without interruptions like family etc that those normal people have.
</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong I'm not thinking of being somekind of special person here, there are "many" triple elite CMDR's out there so this is absolutely nothing new or unique, anyone can reach this goal as long as they are motivated and dedicated... and many have already! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>When reaching triple elite I felt incredible relief like now my elite retirement days start and I can do what I want, when I want as much or little as I want. Almost like, only NOW can I fully enjoy elite... difficult to explain what I mean here heh. Somehow elite just feels so much more relaxed to me now. For example exploration is not about "farming neutron stars" for credits anymore, not about jumping 1000Ly in an hour... no, its about enjoying what galaxy has to offer, fully taking in the breath taking sights.
</p>

<p>For new commanders I would give recommendation which I completely dismissed myself before reaching this goal; Do not rush Triple Elite. Just enjoy the game, the ranks come eventually... no point of burning yourself out going after them like crazy person. Just, absolutely just enjoy Elite <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Also dunno how to explain this, but I played original Elite with Commodore 64 back in 1986 or so, then Frontier Elite with Amiga 500 in the 90's where I never reached any specific rank even though I played original like crazy. This time Elite Dangerous is not just a game, its piece of gaming history and bigger than life... reaching the most sought after rank of Triple Elite was definitely more meaningful that just a simple "status", like said difficult to explain but hopefully you understand.

<p>For example when I reached the last rank part (combat) and was traveling back to the nearest station as Triple Elite, I was so emotional that almost had to stop my ship in super cruise and just take a moment to collect myself as I couldnt believe that I've finally reached this goal. I was actually sitting at the stations hangar for few minutes just taking it all in...
</p>

<p>I am extremely happy that reached this goal, Triple Elite truly is something else <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

2022-01-09T10:15:00Z Special note: I accomplished this back in 2015, since then exploration and mining has had a complete overhaul, if you buy the game in 2022 or later and start to grind triple elite ranking, its not as hard as it was back in 2015. Not to take anything out of newbie commanders efforts in modern era, just stating the facts. One perfect example was the 2020 july low temperature diamonds mining craze, with my second account I went from clear save to Elite Trade rank within HOURS. Just think about that for a moment... things surely have changed a lot in Elite universe.
