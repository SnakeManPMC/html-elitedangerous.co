<p>
2018-12-25T04:01:19Z back in Asp cockpit, lets continue towards the core/colonia waypoints.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T09:22:56Z arrived at Ogaiw TS-U d2-108 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is ridiculously close at mere 390ly, heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T09:45:51Z arrived at Ogaiw ZD-T d3-6 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
I made the decision NOT to go colonia to sell my exploration data. It is risky as I have the codex first discovery for earth like world in drymans point sector which I'm sure many CMDRs will visit, honestly I'm surprised nobody has got it yet.
</p>

<p>
Started towards the next waypoint is "SW" direction. It was about 12k ly away and route plotter actually could not plot so had to make a pit stop around 6k ly point.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T13:48:21Z had some connection issues, servers went down due so many players. Then had to replot route and this time got it done to my next waypoint.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T16:06:39Z had to call it a night even though I wasnt really sleepy tired yet, just didn't have more energy (patience more accurately) to explore more today.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 273, special planets ammonia: 7, earthlike: 3, water: 41, planets smallest: 362.052km, largest: 76106.5km, detail surface scans: 1429.
