	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

<p>
2020-06-22T02:34:49Z Had to take a quick break, shut down Elite, was just so exhausted.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-22T03:03:54Z Back, lets continue mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-22T05:08:06Z Finished mining, 4t LTDs (heh) and 357t tritium, ran out of limpets. The percentages for tritium were horrible bad in this ring <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-22T05:13:14Z Docked. Exhausted, tired too, had to call it a night here. More mining tomorrow, voyage home must continue.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-22T13:25:03Z New Elite day has started, mining tritium must continue.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer fuel depot has 385t of tritium, cargo hold 25t LTDs.
</p>

<p>
Dead tired had to go take a nap... Had a nice nap, cooked some lunch.
</p>

<p>
Then I got to think about this mining grind, I'm not even half way done this one and according to Spansh carrier plotter I am looking at further seven (7) mining pitstops before I reach populated space. I'm thinking that while I'm crazy and love Elite, mining, all that shit... it might be too much. It seems for me to take several hours per load mining tritium so 7 such events... that is just nuts.
</p>

<p>
Another option was to launch elite second account CMDR Snake Man PMC and use PMC PapaBear carrier as fuel tanker, fill it up with tritium and fly it over to PMC Wanderer, refuel and then fly PMC Wanderer back to populated space with one session.
</p>

<p>
On paper that PMC PapaBear option is best time wise, but its no easy task either, loading that bitch up with 23k tons of tritium takes a while, then one day of constant flying there, then another fuel transfer there before I even can begin continuing voyage home. Man that is some crazy ass shit hehe.
</p>

<p>
Also after that once PMC Wanderer reaches home... I have yet another carrier in 24k ly out there which needs to be flown home, I mean no need to do that but she was not intended to be a exploration carrier and I have no idea of her purpose other than to goof around in mining operations.
</p>

<p>
So to recap, PMC Wanderer is in Byoo Aim EP-R b46-0 system, PMC PapaBear is in Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3 system.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about it bit more it just overall felt like complicated plan which would just swap one PMC carrier with another still having the same issues. PMC PapaBear would have about 13k tons of tritium left after the fuel transfer so it could still return home on its own without refueling.
</p>

<p>
I don't know man, these are the hard decisions you have to make which have great impact on the future, I don't like to be put in this position at all <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Simple calculations. One mining session approximate 3hrs lets make it 4hrs to be safe, you need two of these so lets round it up to Spansh estimated 7hrs. So 7 x 7 == 49hrs of fucking mining, haha fuck that shit... I was going to do further calculations and comparisons but realizing how many fucking hours I would be mining alone, yeah fuck that I'm outta here, I'm off to load PMC PapaBear with tritium, that decision came easy after fourty fucking nine hours haha <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-22T21:38:59Z Elite back up, flew PMC Miner 2 back to PMC Wanderer, donated tritium which is now 450t in the fuel depot. Cargo hold has 26t LTDs and 419t limpets.
</p>

<p>
Time to switch into CMDR Snake Man PMC and hop into PMC PapaBear which has now become a rescue ship <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
