	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

</p>

<p>

</p>

</p>

	<h2>2020-06-27</h2>

<p>
2020-06-27T01:44:59Z Dropped into tritium hotspot in Blia Ain VP-N c20-7 4 A Ring.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T03:14:34Z Finished mining session, docked to PMC PapaBear, tritium fuel now 368t. Not much eh. This tritium ring felt somewhat bad, so many fast spinning asteroids and in general the yields were not that good.
</p>

<p>
Tried to plot another jump with Spansh carrier plotted but Blia Ain VP-N c20-7 system was not in the databases, hmm. This causes huge issues as you cannot find a source system... you cant really plot a jump to the next system. Kind of dilemma heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T04:06:21Z Dropped to tritium hotspot.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T06:46:03Z Had another stowaway incident hehe. Now going back to the ring to mine tritium.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T08:28:37Z Uah quite nice sub surface deposit mining session. Got 267t of tritium which is actually quite nice refuel load for PMC PapaBear.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T08:35:18Z Docked at Blia Ain DD-H b24-1/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear fuel depot has 244t tritium and cargo hold the mined 375t.
</p>

<p>
Exited Elite, lunch time, I want to relax a few moments, getting sore sitting and mining heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T09:04:13Z Lunch break is over, we continue PMC PapaBear's journey home...
</p>

<p>
We got 619t of tritium in the fuel depot, lets make a next jump.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T09:48:16Z Docked at Puelue VU-E c25-16/KNX-T6F. Tritium fuel depot 343t now, still can do about two full jumps.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T10:31:15Z Docked at Puelue CN-R b18-2/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear is out of fuel, 64t left heh.
</p>

<p>
Puelue VE-R d4-72 water world for CMDR Snake Man PMC, sent to EDDN as well <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T11:45:55Z Getting really tired, not so much sleepy tired but just exhausted of being playing all day long. Time to park my mining ship to the hangar for some shut eye...
