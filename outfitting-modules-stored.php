<p>
In a fleet carrier when you go to a outfitting and click "Stored Modules", it shows you a list of all modules, hardpoints, utility mounts, core internal and optional internal. On top of the menu it shows number/600 (for example in my case 12/600) and kind of progress bar next to it, this to me suggests there is empty free space for storing modules of 600 items or tons or whatever the count is.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if this 600 number is for CMDR account or simply for this fleet carrier, it feels universal as it includes modules currently stored elsewhere, in my example 12/600 number there was nothing in my carrier so yeah it leads me to believe this 600 is universal storage for modules across the whole station system in Elite.
