	<h2>2015-10-17 Bulletin Board Smuggling Missions</h2>

<p>2015-10-17T12:16:18Z: new bulletin board smuggling mission day starts. Credits 285,5 million and trading rank tycoon status 71%.</p>

<p>First trip out made 48 million. Trading ranking status went up to 79%.</p>

<p>On second trip I returned to Robigo system, was really surprised that I get my cargo hold filled with ONE SINGLE open/private relogin as there was so many very valuable missions available. Heh I should have got Python for the cargo space <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>I then went to Shinrarta Dezhra and purchased Python just for this smuggling business. Python is quite nice smugling ship, except slow fuel scoop (3A) and very short jump range. But it can boost away from interdictions very nicely, not to mention it can carry weapons, a lot of guns.</p>

<p><b>2015-10-18T02:50:57Z: just reached Trading Elite rank! Wohuuu! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy"></b></p>

</p>

<p>2015-10-18T04:30:00Z: finished smuggling for today, last mission completed, uuh exhausted.
<br><br>
Using ASP earlier today did 48 million and then purchased Python and did 128,7 million for total of 176.7 million.</p>

<p>2015-10-18T13:21:43Z: Sothis bulletin board smuggling missions continue. Started with 420,3 million.<br>
2015-10-18T20:31:43Z: finished with 567,8 million, total profit: 147,5 million.<br>
2015-10-18T21:55:53Z: start with 567,8 million.<br>
2015-10-18T23:26:38Z: back at populated space, ready to deliver missions.<br>
2015-10-19T01:57:23Z: finished with 723,2 million, total profit: 155.4 million.<br>
total today: 302,9 million</p>

<p>I was happy doing this extra day of smuggling because the next day developers tweaked the mission spawn rate to bare minimum basically killing this lucrative smuggling scheme.
