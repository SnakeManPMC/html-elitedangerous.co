	<h2>2018-12-15 Earth Like World Tour Is Born</h2>

<p>
2018-12-15T01:04:06Z started to go through my local notes about earth like world discoveries also ammonia and water worlds. I was really surprised to see so many of the systems still having undiscovered bodies and I found even one with undiscovered water world as back then I did not recognize them from system map hehe.
</p>

<p>
So I decided that hey, I'm going for an epic journey of visiting all my old earth like world systems and surface mapping probe them, plus the rest of the system obviously with Full Spectrum Scanner (FSS), especially that missed water world.
</p>

<p>
Now this will be huge journey as the locations are all over the galaxy, but it will be journey with a purpose and if I don't do it now most likely later the system have been surface mapped already.
</p>

<p>
So I started to place bookmarks for galaxy map for all the earth like worlds. I doubt I'll go through water worlds as there are SO many of them, I'm good with earth like worlds.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T02:48:53Z all done for the galaxy map bookmarks, now I just needed to decide how should I proceed because I'm not sure bolting to nearest waypoint is the overall best course of action. If I look at the big picture it might be better to follow the <a href="pmc-galaxy-loop.php" target="_blank">PMC Galaxy Loop</a> route counter clockwise hmm not sure.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T03:42:45Z after a long consideration I decided to go like PMC Galaxy Loop counter clockwise which would feel like a new thing, then either dock at populated space at south end of the route or keep going through Snake Sector into galaxy core from where I would return to my starting location and clockwise loop back to populated space.
</p>

<p>
I would estimate that this route would roughly be 210,000ly <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T03:48:13Z started from Hypi Chroa LI-K d8-9 system! HERE WE GO! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T07:57:56Z arrived at Weqea BZ-H c23-46 system in The Veils sector.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T08:24:13Z arrived at Bleethuia PU-V d3-136, which is our bookmark 1.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T09:29:38Z after scanning the system shut elite down, uuh its been a long day baby...
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T09:30:45Z (after 13hrs exploring) Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 243, special planets earthlike: 5, water: 16, planets smallest: 530.3km, largest: 75980.4km, detail surface scans: 963
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T19:00:36Z woke up and back at my Asp cockpit, time to head towards next waypoint in our earth like world revisit tour <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This system is Pru Chroa Jc-c B13-6 which is very far 13,830.35 ly away, total of 230 hyper jumps (using non scoopable filter) whoah that is quite the hop.
