With these new exploration jumps I did total 231 jumps today, scanned 158 objects, found 4 ammonia, 1 earth like and 38 water worlds. Smallest scanned body radius was 259km landable, largest 77,497km (gas giant).

<p>
2018-12-11T17:00:00Z Elite Dangerous v3.3 Beyond was released.
</p>

<p>
Servers were hammered, I actually got the update downloaded real quickly like within 2 minutes and then got to play for maybe 10min until the servers started to fail as more and more commanders were downloading and playing. Then I had to stop because for over an hour I could not get a working server. Continued playing like 2200hrs and then after midnight the servers started to work.
