	<h2>2019-09-20 New Highscore Smallest Landable Planet</h2>

<p>
2019-09-20T00:13:01Z back in elite, lets explore.
</p>

<p>
I'm system map visual scanning all landable planet surfaces now, carefully and calmly without any rush. I'm currently thinking that whats the point of exploring if all you do is jump & honk and only to stop scanning special planets, like you dont scan anything unless you see ammonia, earth-like or water world signals in FSS.
</p>

<p>
Obviously this is a huge time sink, if you spend all day doing this it depends mostly on number of landable planets you discover and even about how much time you spend in FSS, that you might not be able to jump more than 20-30 systems in average day. Difficult to say as I'm only been doing this for day or two now, but yes absolutely this is really slow progress on exploration journey, obviously.
</p>

<p>
Guess I'm just trying to enjoy the exploration instead of the usual jump & honk stress.

2019-09-20T08:50:02Z Getting little exhausting to play again, time to call it a night even though its not even close to night for me. Was a pretty good exploring day today, found a new highscore planet so gotta be happy with that <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
