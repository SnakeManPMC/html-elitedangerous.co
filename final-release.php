	<h1>PMC Elite Dangerous - Final Release</h1>

<p>
Elite Dangerous 2014 Final Game Release. This obviously is not final release for the game forever, this was v1.0 final version release, the launch of the game, the big moment all Alpha backers and preview Beta testers had waited for a long time.

<p>
Final Release News:<br>
- 25% off in-game ship insurance for life to all our Beta backers<br>
- free access to one of the 5 new ships when it's released!<br>
- not all 25 ships will be available upon release.<br>
<br><br>
Final Release December 16th, 2014.<br>
- We're aiming not to have to regenerate the galaxy after gamma release. Individual systems might be changed for fixes, but not the system as a whole. It depends on what comes up though.<br>
- While freely available at the moment, Dropship ownership will be restricted in the game, depending on your allegiance to either the Empire or the Federation.<br>
- http://elitedangerous.com/extra/newsletter_2014_10_31/DestinationListAtEarth.jpg<br>
- assume there will be a wipe on December 16th.<br>
<br><br>
Post Final Release News:<br>
- there will eventually be 30 playable ships (It means there will be more ships over time, not on the 16th).<br>
- After the 16th December we will continue to update with more polish and content such as the playable ships we committed to in our Kickstarter campaign<br>
- I would say that an offline rewrite of the game is unlikely for the future.<br>
- The future intent is to have some (but not all) outposts have large docking pads. No ETA or anything, but it is on our lists.
