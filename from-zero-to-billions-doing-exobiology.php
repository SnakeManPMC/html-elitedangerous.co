	<h2>From Zero To Billions Doing Exobiology</h2>

<p>
Starter sidewinder and 250k credits. Equip sidewinder with better Frame Shift Drive (FSD), do not remove Shield Generator. Buy <b>Artemis Suit</b> from <b>PIONEER SUPPLIES</b> in the starter station you're at.
</p>

<p>
Start doing missions that you find from station services bulletin board, do this until you have money for Detailed Surface Scanner. Buy detailed surface scanner and if you had any leftover credits, a fuel scoop of any class.
</p>

<p>
Use Spansh expressway to exomastery route planner, right here in the bubble it doesn't matter that you wont be getting first footfall bonuses. Use 16 million credit landmark minimum value, you are not interested in anything less (not even the 16m to be honest). Setup sidewinder jump range, use like 50 LY radius along the path, input your current system but no destination system, untick loop, generate route.

<p>
Then just keep scanning profitable stratum tectonicas. You could keep Elite Observatory with Bioinsights which shows you estimated credits from current scans. Do this until you reach 58 million credits. PMCTODO links for observatory and bioinsights missing at 2025-06-06T11:29:21Z
</p>

<p>
Buy mandalay with Shield Generator and Detailed Surface Scanner, otherwise same as PMC EDDN Sender template ship (meaning good jump range). PMCTODO edsy.org link for this ship build is missing at 2025-06-06T11:28:01Z
</p>

<p>
Depart to very far away from the populated space so you can get exobiology first footfall bonuses. Explore, search biological signals for exobiology sample scans, do profitable stratum tectonicas and others (bioinsights have good info on this).
</p>

<p>
Do this until you have billions. Easy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
