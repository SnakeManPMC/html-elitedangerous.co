	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

	<h2>2020-06-25 Mining Low Temperature Diamonds</h2>

<p>
2020-06-25T17:59:23Z New Elite day has started by refueling PMC Miner 2, flying it to the LTD triple overlapping hotspot ring... and taking a lunch break <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-25T18:26:08Z Lunch is done, now lets start mining some low temperature diamonds.
</p>

<p>

	<h2>2020-06-26 Mining Low Temperature Diamonds</h2>

<p>
2020-06-26T02:35:34Z CMDR Snake Man PMC finished quick sub surface deposit mining of tritium in Byoo Aim EP-R b46-0 system. PMC PapaBear fuel depot now 670t. Carrier balance 88.535 million and weekly upkeep 7.998 million.
</p>

<p>
A rough calculation that if I leave PMC PapaBear in this system while I go mine using main PMC Wanderer carrier, CMDR Snake Man PMC balance runs out in 13 weeks. Knowning this I'm comfortable going back to PMC Wanderer for at least end of october. Now that is a lifetime Elite wise <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T02:52:53Z Shut down Elite for CMDR Snake Man PMC.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T02:58:13Z Started Elite with normal CMDR Snake Man. Now lets see what kind of mining should we do.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T03:08:57Z Arrived at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2 and positioned myself to the 4 sub surface deposit LTD asteroid 25km away from the center hotspot, now just waiting for pirates to go away before starting mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T04:53:51Z This mining session finished, dumped LTDs to carrier now total 1561t.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T05:03:37Z Decided to go Deciat, to check if PMC Explorer's FSD could be further engineered. I believe its on the legacy engineering now and needs to be upgraded.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T05:14:55Z Docked at Deciat/Farseer Inc. Ready to start engineering. My current ship jump range is 60.40ly unladen 64.57ly. After converting legacy mod into present day engineering and engineering it up to the max current ship jump range 63.69ly and unladen 68.12ly. So pretty nice increase just by visiting here and pressing few buttons. Why didn't I do this earlier? <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T05:28:16Z Docked at Shinrarta Dezhra/Jameson Memorial. Just tested some jump range, oddly enough cant even remember what it was before (other than what I wrote above) but in general I always jump like 61-63ly anyways so dunno. Came to Jameson Memorial to buy super cruise assist module as it was on my list and this station is one of those that you don't need to wonder if something is in stock or not.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T07:13:42Z Back in the LTD3 joint, lets mine some more while I decide what to do next.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T08:03:38Z Lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T08:24:36Z Lunch break over.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T09:02:07Z Ran out of sub surface deposit missiles, time to head home. Got 590t of LTDs in the cargo.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T09:14:01Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-4/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer stock now 2151t of LTDs.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-26 PMC PapaBear On The Move</h2>

<p>
2020-06-26T09:42:12Z haha decided to start CMDR Snake Man PMC and do few hyper jumps towards the first refuel point <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Flip flop! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T13:13:44Z Mining completed, 207t of tritium in cargo hold. Nice catch for just casual "lets check those rings out".
</p>

<p>
2020-06-26T14:06:22Z Enough Elite for today, just too tired to concentrate, have to get some shut eye...
