	<h2>2016-08-29</h2>

<p>2016-08-29T02:51:04Z arrived to Crescent Sector DL-Y d29 which is the crescend nebula. All explored by CMDR's already. Nebulas are for CMDR's like shit is to flies it seems. I won't be visiting many nebulas because of this, I have no desire to explore someone's leftovers, I need virgin exploration material <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Most likely the CMDR explored nebulas reduce once we get beyond 20,000Ly... dunno, I might be wrong, those things do attract people so much, even me... but like I said, I have no desire of going to some tourist hot spot as exploration for me is to discover the never before seen unknowns of the galaxy.
</p>

<p>I had to jump about 200Ly out from Crescent nebula with fastest route planning to get rid of the all systems explored by CMDR's annoyance.

<p>2016-08-31T05:09:43Z arrived to Preae Eurk UT-Z d13-16 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 02.
