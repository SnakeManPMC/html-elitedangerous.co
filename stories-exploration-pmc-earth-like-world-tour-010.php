<p>
2018-12-19T06:16:17Z arrived at Wruethoi WD-T c3-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was very close only 740ly away.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T06:32:27Z arrived at Bya Freau AW-H b51-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was even closer, mere 296ly away. A lot of earth like worlds here heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T06:44:49Z arrived at Bya Freau CB-F d11-5 system which is my ELW bookmark. Third and last on this close area.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 5128ly away, not too far but takes 87 jumps on realistic plotting, most likely going to use good stars filter which extends it to 90, not too bad.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T13:57:35Z was in Myoangua GR-N d6-150 system and scanned two water worlds, that concluded my todays elite session, its been a long damn day heh.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 301, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 7, water: 36, planets smallest: 385.983km, largest: 77189.8km, detail surface scans: 1689. This stat includes at least two sets of earth like and water worlds which I already had discovered last year.

<p>
2018-12-19T21:24:55Z woke up and back in Asp cockpit, lets continue our journey towards the current waypoint.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T22:27:42Z at Schignua LF-A c25 system was starting to surface map a water world, approached it like any other of the hundreds I've done so far using the 7 second rule, when got to surface scanner range I had a brain fart, I activated the scanner before I pulled throttle back and before I had time to react to shut down the scanner and steer clear of the water world... boom I crashed into the exclusion zone and dropped out of super cruise. Took 1% damage to hull and all internal modules got 2% heh. Must have been some early morning before breakfast brain failure indeed.
</p>

<p>
Oh well now I have story to tell how I crashed into a planet <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
