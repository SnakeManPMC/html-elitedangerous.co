<p>
2020-07-01T23:18:10Z New Elite day has started. Okay overnight I got reports from friend CMDR that he cannot sell more than 4t at once, damn. When I got in-game and checked markets no tritium was sold and LTDs balance was 725t so only 47t got sold through, oh man.
</p>

<p>
Well in any case I'm jumping PMC Wanderer now to the selling station and most likely will haul this cargo for sale myself using PMC Trader, just so I can get back to business quicker, its its US gaming prime time now and actually few EU guys are still awake.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T23:38:03Z Well managed to shuffle back and forth with both accounts, CMDR Snake Man PMC sold from 140t diamonds down to 56t left when the carrier just would not accept any more sales.
</p>

<p>
Started real account and now its time to move this carrier into selling station and sell some diamonds there.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T23:55:16Z Plotted PMC Wanderer jump to Chel system. Going there now with PMC Explorer to scan it and prepare for carriers arrival.
</p>

<p>
I would have much more preferred to be in the sell system Parenni, but it was full, no free slots left for carriers. So Chel is the next system closest to it.
</p>

<p>
This jump from Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-4 to Chel consumes 92t of tritium fuel. Its probably because carrier is very light weight now, not much LTDs on board. Well not "much" but yeah. Anyways rule of thumb is one jump to sell/mining is 100t of fuel.
</p>

<p>
Then started to spam system chat with "selling LTDs for 1,548,553 cr/ton, supply 4503t. PMC Wanderer in Chel." heh.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-02 Fleet Carrier Business Man</h2>

<p>
2020-07-02T00:49:43Z Docked at Parenni/Alvares City. Sold 790t of LTDs for 1.302 BILLION! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Docked back to PMC Wanderer and updated system chat spam "selling LTDs for 1,548,553 cr/ton, supply 3713t. PMC Wanderer in Parenni B 1." aayeah, we're in business.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T01:35:22Z All diamonds SOLD OUT! I can't fucking believe this! haha this is awesome! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Switching back to second account, going to sell the python load of LTDs, then back to PMC Wanderer and real account, fly her to the col 285 mines again. Yeah buddy!
</p>

<p>
Announced departure few times, went to toilet and came back announcing some more. Then we were off to col 285 LTD3 mines.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T02:09:16Z PMC Wanderer status; 817t tritium in fuel depot, 2054t tritium in cargo. Carrier budget 7.691 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T02:14:05Z Switch to second account, I'm gonna do some mining and advertising my 1.5m/4.5k demand buy order <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T02:18:33Z Okay finally back at CMDR Snake Man PMC piloting PMC Miner 6 python, 125t limpets on board, ready to go mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T02:25:23Z Started mining. Hopefully getting nice finds and yields, getting that cargo hold full quickly so I can get to sell for PMC Wanderer <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T03:54:11Z Done mining 224t cargo, PMC Wanderer buy order was fullfilled, had to switch CMDRs again to get orders fixed haha.
</p>

<p>
Had to do a real life chore here.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T05:02:09Z Back at Elite. PMC Wanderer tritium buy order is now 15t so pretty much sold, guess the CMDRs donated for that 40k something per ton, good to have always small amount of tritium to buy.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T05:12:16Z Set sell order for 5034t of LTD heh, now trying to get a free carrier slot from Parenni.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T06:10:33Z LTDs were flying off the cargo racks like crazy! It literally took mere minutes to go from 5034t to 26t last ones.
</p>

<p>
Not even a minute later when I typed the above, the last 26t was sold out. I then plotted route back to col 285 LTD3 rings and also set 20t buy order for tritium and massive 5100t order for LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T06:31:23Z PMC Wanderer jumped to col 285 LTD3 ring nearby. Lets switch to second account and go mining, but first... lunch break! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T06:37:13Z Switched to second account, going to the LTD3 rings but thursday server maintenance is coming so only going to advertise LTD buying.
</p>

<p>
Sold 224t of LTDs for 336.1 million, credits now 2.412 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T07:48:32Z Started mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T09:32:31Z Finished mining, docked at PMC Wanderer, I was suprised to see there was about 1400t demand left even though someone said in system chat that its almost empty, guess their empty is relative or that they were simply bullshitting, some people seem to have nothing better to do.
</p>

<p>
Sold 224t from cargo and 10t from refinery bins, didn't check the price but should be the same, credits now 2.763 billion. Half way through to get CMDR Snake Man PMC second account <i>second</i> fleet carrier <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to switch into real account, hop back into col 285 LTD3 rings to announce more LTD buying.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T10:06:18Z At my real account, all of LTD buy order had been fullfilled, also tritium sold to only 6t left in the buy order. Market prices also came down to 1.3 million at best paying station, uh oh... now I'm sitting in a mountain of diamonds which are overpriced for the current market, wonder how long do I have to wait until the prices increase.
</p>

<p>
Current cargo is 5100t of LTDs, 2093t of tritium and few limpets heh. Carrier credit balance 268.5 million.
</p>

<p>
Guess I'm going back to mining with second account again, prices arent that good with 1.3 million but its better than doing nothing, hell some days back I happily sold at 1.1 so yeah.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T10:36:48Z Shut Elite down, need to decide what to do but most likely its continuing mining with second account. How many times have I switched today? <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After mopping up some video merging etc I decided to call it a night on PMC Gaming, just felt like slightly exhausted and nothing I could do in Elite anymore today would make much of a difference so better end today here instead of forcing and perhaps getting really bad mood from the last few hours of game-play. More tomorrow.
