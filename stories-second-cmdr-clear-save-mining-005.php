	<h2>2020-07-04 LTD Markets Crashed 1.1 Million Best Price</h2>

<p>
2020-07-04T10:48:09Z New Elite day has started! Booted it up with real account as I need to go adjust PMC Wanderr LTD buy order, market prices crashed just hour ago and best selling station is only 1.1 million right now. So I'll set PMC Wanderer to buy LTDs at 1 million per ton.
</p>

<p>
LTD buy order 4247t for 1,000,553 per ton.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T10:54:34Z Docked at Lan Tzak/V4F-G4G. Booted second account CMDR up, hopefully I spend all day playing with this now. I want to do some mining to get credits for PMC PapaBear balance, hopefully in day or so I can activate those outfitting services with some mining equipment.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear plotted jump to Trante system where it will refuel, cheap tritium in that system.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T11:37:56Z Docked at Trante/JLJ-3QK. Unknown tritium buying carrier, 38k profit per ton for tritium so I hauled a load. Sold 704t for 26.7 million, credits now (personal account) ? forgot to write down haha.
</p>

<p>
Docked to one carrier which name said buy tritium 50k / ton, but obviously there was no demand, so back to the first guy.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T11:56:36Z Docked at Trante/JLJ-3QK. Sold same load, credits 59.845 million. Then I went to bring in.. err two more loads, sorry I didn't write it down haha.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T12:54:45Z Quick lunch break was done just now.
</p>

<p>
This system had the cheapest tritium according to inara at 3880cr or something like that, but still it was very quiet, low activity, not many traders and system chat was almost dead. I saw one guy offering type-9 hauling services for refueling carriers.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T13:49:10Z Created tritium buy order for 2000t with 43,058 per ton. Announced it on system chat.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T14:37:13Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. Arrived to col 285 LTD3 rings, we are going to mine... mine A LOT <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear cargo now has tritium 3854t plus whats in tritium depot 297t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T14:44:40Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, just came here to check things out and EDMC update EDDN feed with latest data, I believe our LTD buy order was not sent to EDDN last night.
</p>

<p>
The buy order I set last night was still there nobody had sold anything which is explained by the EDDN not having the data and me not being in system chat advertising it.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T14:58:46Z Arrived to the 4 sub surface deposit asteroid, but need to wait until AI pirates jump away.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T18:58:37Z Finished mining, ran out of sub surface deposit drill missiles. This felt like it took a long time, but I stopped few times to read chat and I also had a lunch. Anyways 701t of LTDs in cargo, pretty nice haul.
</p>

<p>
I would like to go sell these... but the prices are so awfully low that I need to just store in PMC PapaBear in order to wait for those 1.6 maybe 1.7 million crazy prices again. Now I finally have a carrier where I can store while I casually mine, no rush for anything, its like where would I need urgent cash right now... I have nothing to buy, already got the carrier, now only thing to do is enjoy mining and focus on the highest profits, no point selling LTDs cheap.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-04T20:36:20Z Been up 16hrs, time to call it a night.
