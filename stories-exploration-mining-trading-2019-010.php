2019-09-13T03:44:28Z finally ran out of limpets, got 626t painite and 14t of palladium in cargo hold. Nice haul, but it was 6hrs, hmm quite a long time.
</p>

<p>
Used TradeDangerous to check painite sell prices, found Perktomen/Rominger Station with 870k, it was 146ly and 18 jumps away. That is quite far and the risk for AI fake scripted pirates to attack me increase by each jump. The dangerous journey begins ...
</p>

<p>
Interdiction on second jump, 85% hull, THERMAL ATTACK coocooland kiddie bullshit. I decided to make a pitstop at zaonce to repair my hull, but before I reached there I got another interdiction, it was a high security system and police arrived when the clipper was shooting at me, luckily he didn't get my shields down before I escaped.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T04:19:10Z docked at Zaonce/Ridley Scott for repairs. Man I was SO nervous on this one, how many hundreds of MILLIONS worth of cargo on board heh. Repairs cost me 16.6k credits. I did check how much painite is bought here but it was dirt cheap, gotta continue.
</p>

<p>
Perktomen is 11 jumps away, don't even need to refuel before reaching it. Now its just matter of fake ass retard scripted AI interdictions... 11 jumps, will they get me or not...
</p>

<p>
Decided to switch galaxy map filter to high-security systems, just in case it might help me with interdictions. I don't care about how much damage I get, as long as I don't die. If AI interdicts but police drops in almost immediately and I head towards the police ships... I just might make it.
</p>

<p>
But first system to jump to was LOW security, eh? Guess the filter just attempts to plot route for selected systems but falls back to whatever necessary to complete the route, dunno.
</p>

<p>
Man was I scared when jumping as looked like every damn jump is into low or at best medium security system, it was hilarious as there was NO high security systems <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Got pirate threats on radio comms but managed to jump away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T04:46:01Z docked at Perktomen/Rominger Station with a HUGE sigh of relief <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Sold 14x palladium for 221.7k profit. When doing that I got few more painite refined from the refinery bin hopper thing, now I have 634t of painite. Sold that for 858.5k per unit profit, so total of 544.3 MILLION profit <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
My budget now 4.835 billion heh.
</p>

<p>
And it was time to call it a night here, nothing I could do tonight anymore which could top this achievement so better to call it quits while feeling great.
