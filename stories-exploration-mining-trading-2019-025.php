	<h2>2019-09-29 Quick Try At Bounty Hunting</h2>

<p>
2019-09-29T09:00:43Z Docked at jameson memorial, decided to try some bounty hunting. Was really surprised to see that I don't have my combat python anymore, hum where did I sell her for eh?
</p>

<p>
Since I was in jameson memorial and had this planned for quite some time already, I went and <b>sold all my ships which had no use</b>. Years ago I bought all the ships at the time just to have them, but now I realize having ships "just because" is dumb, you always have to scroll through that very long ship list for no reason.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T09:50:09Z Transferred couple of imperial crap ships to Jameson Memorial, shuffled useless ship outfitting and sold them. Balance 5.588 billion credits.

2019-09-29T11:05:08Z Took out vulture, added few outfitting items to it and then took it out for a spin in nearby anarchy system. <a href="https://edsy.org/#/L=FN00000H4C0S10,FEP00FEP00,mpUDx600Dho00,9p310A7210AOE00AcI00Aqq00B7a00BLA00BZY10,,7Sk006D2004xo00,PMC_0Bounty_0Hunter,PMC008" target="_blank">edsy.org PMC Bounty Hunter Specifications</a>.

2019-09-29T11:05:37Z arrived at Crucis Sector FM-V b2-4 system, security: ANARCHY. Well this system has no population, so no stations and therefore pretty much no ship traffic. I was flying around a bit just to check things out.
</p>

<p>
Visited Er 8 system and <a href="resource-extraction-sites.php">Resource Extraction Site (RES)</a> there, took down two wanted ships. This felt like boring, all the magical "HUNT" idea that I had for bounty hunting was just not there. The RES was the usual stuff that I've done to the death, there is zero hunt. I supercruised in Gnowee system and found wanted Asp, interdicted it, kill warrant scanned and then opened fire. Gnowee system is low security and I was quite surprised as system security ships appeared really quickly after the Asp opened fire on me, with the security ships it was piece of cake to kill this Asp, got like 40k bounty voucher for it. Cool, I guess?
</p>

<p>
Interdicted diamondback explorer, cops joined in but the DBX escaped high waking, I followed and found him from supercruise but when he dropped out to a station, then I lost him, or rather he was just not there anymore. That was, somewhat exciting like I expected bounty hunting to be, that hunt and tracking etc.
</p>

<p>
Tried to chase down a vulture twice, but he oddly enough was not interested of fighting, he just high waked out heh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T12:36:20Z docked at jameson memorial, time to tweak outfitting a bit, by mistake I got gimballed pulse lasers and they need to be switched to fixed ones. On the combat got some internal module damage, hull 99% state, repairs cost 1.6k credits.

2019-09-29T14:35:40Z I was in Kutkha system where I followed vulture who high waked away. Its been difficult to find wanted ships, you need to be in high population system to get a lot of ships and then which ones are wanted is kind of luck thing. No idea if lower or anarchy systems would provide more wanted ships.
</p>

<p>
In any case its been... rather boring, been spending all this time and haven't got more than three kills and even two of those were in RES, heh quite boring indeed. Not only boring but the progress is completely stalled when you just search the wanted ships, I thought the hunt and tracking would be cool... but when most ships are not wanted, its not that fun to just sit and wait.
</p>

<p>
With trading or mining every minute you use counts for progress in terms of credit profit.
</p>

<p>
Of course one could argue that this anticipation of the wanted ships, the hunt, is elevating the excitement when you finally get into combat situation and score a kill. Dunno.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-29T14:54:58Z Interdicted wanted imperial courier, which high waked out as I opened fire. I then set course to jameson memorial, time to go back to mining or trading where I can make real progress, bounty hunting is boring.
