	<h2>Galaxy Map Bookmarks</h2>

<p>
Do not create too many galaxy map bookmarks as they clutter the milky way map and makes navigating bookmarks difficult. Yes even after Frontier Developments added some categories to bookmarks like systems, bodies, stations and such, its still easily gets cluttered if you just bookmark anything you come across. Bookmarks are only for very VERY important locations.
</p>

<p>
Galaxy map and <a href="system-map.php">system map</a> has a graphical user interface (GUI) icon at the bottom of right side of the screen which is copy to clipboard, you can use this to grab any system name as text copy-paste and put it to your own text file notes. Then you can write as long descriptions as you want for any systems in such txt file.
</p>

<p>
For exploration its nice to drop bookmark icons into the big whopping galaxy map on some remote locations you've visited, visually on that huge milky way galaxy they are fine, just remember that any bookmark you create... will appear in one of those categories and is there to cluttering things up.

<p>
I am not sure but someone mentioned that galaxy map bookmark limit is 200, I have not tested this but as a number that sounds quite low, but if you were to plop 200 bookmarks into the populated space area, or at least the original the bubble area, it would be quite cluttered view.
