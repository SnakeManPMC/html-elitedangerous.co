<p>2015-03-27: read OnePercent triple Elite interview in newsletter and got inspired, decided to go for this goal.<br>
2015-03-28T23:42:02Z: started exploring, only maybe 1000Ly away from populated space.</p>

<p>2015-03-30T00:24:13Z: stop to unload first batch of exploration data at TSU, then proceeded to explore. Went to north armerica, cave and NGC 7822 nebulas. Then decided to go check out galactic core (not sagittarius a* specifically but just the center core).</p>

<p>2015-04-03: continuing towards sagittarius a* galactic center. Sagittarius A* at 2015-04-03T23:44:48Z</p>

<p>2015-04-04: 1955hrs decided to come back to populated space so could sell the exploration data. 25,586Ly traveling ahead of me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-05T16:43:23Z: journey continues from 15,533Ly point towards populated space. Traveling at 1,000Ly up in galaxy plane.</p>

<p>2015-04-06T03:52:17Z: at Droju sector had to (first time?) re-plot my route as there were so many unscoopable dwarf stars <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-06T06:50:16Z: arrived at Snake Sector YV-M b7-5 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-06T07:23:38Z: arrived at Tsu and docked to Ziemkiewicz Ring. Journey is over, time to sell exploration data <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 27,303,155 and after 64,599,494 so made total of 37,296,339 credits. Spend time selling this cartography data 1h 21min hehe. I was really disappointed that it was THIS LOW amount, I already said if its under 50 million I will be disappointed and I secretly wished I rank up to Elite with over 100 million profit with one go... boy, was I wrong or what, huh! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-07T10:51:34Z: arrived to Shinrarta Dezhra to outfit exploring Anaconda for 39.35Ly jump range, then went to 2000Ly test drive <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-04-07T12:51:10Z: arrived to Shinrarta Dezhra. Test drive was ok but ASP is still the best exploring ship, no doubt.</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 34,464,966 and after 35,140,002 so made total of 675,036 credits. This was about 2000Ly trip.</p>
