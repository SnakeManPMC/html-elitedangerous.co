2019-09-13T20:44:58Z docked at jameson memorial, tucked in PMC Trader and brought out PMC Explorer.
</p>

<p>
Was checking out my asp in edsy.org and noticed I could squeeze in a bit more jump range and speed with replacing 3B power plant to 3C. Jump range now 63.04ly <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T20:55:56Z Plotted route about 10k ly towards east and departed jameson memorial.
</p>

<p>
Decided to jump with honk but without checking system map for one hour straight because I wanted to get away from populated space and the stench of other commanders, I recall from my january 2019 exploration trip that other commanders pollution on discoveries extends thousands of light years from populated space so its pointless to even check system map before you are far enough away.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember to what thousand number the range was set last time, but it might have been angrily said to be like nice round number of 10,000ly.
</p>

<p>
So now I set alarm timer to my phone that I'm going to jump straight for one hour without checking system map, then I'll check how far away I got and evaluate if I should start to check system map yet. I doubt one hour is enough, thats nothing like two or three thousand light years, I cant remember heh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T21:58:35Z arrived at Pro Eur UC-M c7-29 system which was one hour of constant jumping with minimum of fuel scooping, absolutely no wasted time ALT-TABbing etc, this was as fast as I can travel one hour. Result was distance to sol 4,484ly which REALLY surprised me, I was expecting like two max three thousand light years heh.
</p>

<p>
Guess the 63.04ly jump range in PMC Explorer ASP rulez <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This one hour jumping felt like nothing, I honestly was surprised my alarm went off like "huh!? what already?" heh, so I decided to do another one hour jumping session, this would also give more confirmation to the first one.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T23:08:53Z arrived at Prooe Dryoae ZF-L d9-32 system another hour of straight jumping, distance to sol 8,891ly so pretty much the same amount traveled as in the first hour. So its easy to say that if PMC Explorer ASP is in hurry it can go 4.4k ly in an hour.
</p>

<p>
Took a quick break to scan my notes and did not find any info how large range around bubble there is for other CMDR polluted systems, like when you can start to scan systems without worrying about already dicovered systems.
</p>

<p>
I decided to start scan systems now with 8.8k ly distance to sol. Let's see how many already discovered systems I come across with.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T23:58:35Z arrived at Prae Dryou EM-T a85-1 system and thought about going to visit Sanguineous Rim region so plotted course there.
