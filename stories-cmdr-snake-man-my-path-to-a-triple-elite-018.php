<p>2015-11-04T07:24:33Z: took a few days break from Elite playing, got bored if not burnt out for the combat. It was refreshing to totally shut my brain off from any Elite related (gaming, IRC, web, videos, everything).</p>

<p>2015-11-04T10:36:52Z: picked up my combat python from Jameson Memorial in attempt to test some pulse laser setups (low heat generation) for it. It didn't take more playing than this for me to get bored for the conflict zone mindless shooting mayhem...
<br><br>
Python test tour was rather quick, I again picked up anaconda and continued on conflict zone fighting.</p>

<p>2015-11-04T17:34:55Z: End of the day was Dangerous 22% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-05: End of the day was Dangerous 26% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-06T08:05:43Z: End of the day was Dangerous 29% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-08T13:45:32Z: themroc (EDDB author) was returning from exploration journey to galactic core, I went out to Snake Sector to meet him and to escort him back.</p>

<p>We arrived at HIP 72043 system, Kippax Ring station at 17:55:09Z. Mission accomplished! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-11-11T14:37:09Z: picked up my anaconda and arrived to Komovoy system for some continuing combat rank progression. Apparently the conflict zones were gone, only one low intensity left, hoh. Had to move into Solati system.</p>

<p>2015-11-11: End of the day was Dangerous 36% rank.</p>
