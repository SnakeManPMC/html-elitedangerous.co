<p>
Next waypoint is 13,312.69 ly and 233 hyper jumps away, uuh these distances are killing me hehe. Well you knew the magnitude when you signed up for this shit so shut the hell up <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to scan few systems now and relax, as the previous waypoint was all jumping only to stop scanning the usual special planets.

2018-12-16T04:32:20Z called it for a night. Quite weak, only played 11hrs or so, but have to do some chores before sleeping tonight so better get a head start on those before I get tired.

<p>
2018-12-16T23:11:21Z arrived at Blo Chroa GB-L b35-0 system. Felt just absolutely gutless and very tired which is amazing considering I slept 8h 48min last night, this must be some major sleep depravation cycle filling up or something heh. Had to go take a nap so shut down PMC Gaming computer as I really do not want to leave it burning electricity while I just sleep.
