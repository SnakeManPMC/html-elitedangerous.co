	<h2>2020-07-06 PMC Wanderer Buy Order Fulfilled</h2>

<p>
2020-07-06T00:13:15Z Brand new Elite day has started. First I checked with real account PMC Wanderer and it had ran out of LTD buy order, all 1535t LTDs bought out. I'm surprised because after setting that buy order I basically logged out of Elite and went to bed, it completely sold out without me being in system chat pimping it, very nice indeed.
</p>

<p>
Also from tritium buying 20t it was down to 16t, someone emptied few of those as well, always good even though its meant more as donation thing.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer now has LTDs 6780t, that is a nice load. I then added last buy order of 790t of LTDs.
</p>

<p>
Currently its sunday-monday night and its a busy one at that as always, EDDN server is all but dead, cannot send new price update.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T00:53:53Z EDDN was still down I could not just sit and wait in PMC Wanderer real account, had to switch to second account and go mine some LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T01:03:49Z Second account booted up, lets check all PMC Miner 7 systems and head off to mining.
</p>

<p>
Started mining, forgot to write down time. System chat was extremely offensive today at this time, it haven't been like this in days.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T03:17:13Z Finished mining, getting so tired have no mental energy to mine some more. Cargo 399t LTDs and still had 37t limpets left as well plenty of drill missiles, but had to call it here, will continue after a short nap.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T07:11:09Z Nap is over, back in Elite. Checked PMC Wanderer first, its LTD demand has been sold to 330t demand left, good. Then switched back to second account and back to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T07:17:20Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear, repaired, rearmed and refueled. Offloaded cargo to carrier which is now 2508t LTDs. Then off to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T08:09:50Z Got 174t of LTDs in cargo, now its lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T08:57:30Z Lunch break over, back to mining them diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T10:48:46Z PMC Wanderer last 330t demand for LTDs has been fulfilled, great. Now it doesn't have any more credit balance to add more buy orders, need to sell some.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking... I might switch back to real account game-play so I can fully devote time building CMDR Snake Man credit balance up. Would mine some at first, sell which ever place pays the highest and then add some more buy orders for PMC Wanderer, to keep things rolling until the high market prices return.
</p>

<p>
Have to think about that...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T10:59:09Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear, offloaded 630t LTD cargo to the carrier, current status 3138t LTDs and 3857t tritium.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I'm a bit bored of mining and waiting for better market prices, but now I just want to switch into real account playing for time being (besides the eventual market price increase when I need to sell PMC PapaBear cargo). Feels like I've done enough with second account for PMC PapaBear now, this 3138 * 1.5 million would come to 4.7 billion and I would not sell this load with one point five, so yeah, I'm looking for a good payout when the time comes, PMC PapaBear is all good man.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T11:24:36Z Shut down Elite, most likely continue with real account from now on until market prices increase.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T11:32:13Z Elite back up with real account, now we are going to maintain and make some credits for the real me, eh? hehe <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Used PMC Explorer and went to visit both corona and the new fake "LTD4" system, corona looked real nice with very clear asteroid field, I'd like to mine there. Also only one person in both systems greeted my greeting in system chat, very very quiet complete opposite what col 285 LTD3 rings are.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T13:31:39Z Back to PMC Miner 2 and some self launcher fighter (SLF) exploit mining <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T14:21:47Z Lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T14:45:36Z Lunch break is over, lets get back to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T16:08:59Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, offloaded cargo and invetory now 8279t LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T19:29:01Z Cargo hold full 704t LTDs and refinery bins 10t full as well. We are RTB.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T19:34:16Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3/Q1L-19Z. After offloading PMC Wanderer has 8991t of LTDs heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-06T19:38:21Z Decided to call it a night, not really tired or exhausted yet but doing another mining run would be a struggle, so better to end here with a good mood and continue tomorrow. Hey who knows maybe tomorrow we get a better prices and finally we get to sell to make some credits.
