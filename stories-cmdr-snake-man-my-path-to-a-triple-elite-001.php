	<h2>Beginning Statistics</h2>

<p>Beginning statistics as reference. Also rough estimate how long time it takes to reach this goal, however as you can read below this estimate went so belly up its not even funny. This below status and estimate was written in 2015-04-03 and while I could have easily deleted whole thing I really wanted to leave it here as reminder of what my expectactions were when starting this. Also hopefully this helps anyone who thinks about same kind of plan to reach this goal.

Combat<br>
Bounties claimed: 171<br>
Combat bonds: 10<br>
Total kills: 181<br><br>

Trading<br>
451,1 million<br><br>

Exploring<br>
12,3 million
</p>

<p>Combat Elite ranking is 8750 kills. <i>Outdated/incorrect info</i></p>

<p>Trading Elite ranking is 1013 million traded. I have 451,1 so need 561,9 million. I can trade 10 million a day which is 56.1 days! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Okay so I have to trade at least 20 million per day which is 28 days, heh a month of straigh up trading then? ehhh, the horror... the horror <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Exploration Elite ranking is 119,9 million. I have 12,3 million so I need 107.6 million. Impossible to say how many millions you can make in a day as exploration usually is several days straight out in wild.</p>

<p><b>Important Update!</b> Developers changed these exploration ranking values while I was exploring, so updated info is that to reach Elite ranking you need exploration profits of 158 million credits</p>

<p>Time it takes to triple Elite<br>
1) exploration 7 days???<br>
2) trading 28 days <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>
3) combat 14 days<br>
total 49 days, ETA May 22nd, maybe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Really rough date estimates. Apr 10th exploration elite. May 8th, trading elite. May 22nd, combat elite.</p>
