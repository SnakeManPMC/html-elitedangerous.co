<p>
2020-07-12T09:35:05Z New Elite day has started. It begins by returning PMC Miner 3 sub-surface deposit python back to the carrier, then go EDDN update PMC PapaBear as well.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T09:51:38Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear docking shows 990t LTD demand left, oh nice.
</p>

<p>
Its sad to see how few CMDR's truly use EDDN sending software. Just docked to my second carrier which had 5hrs old data with only few dozen LTDs bought, well the actual status is almost three thousand diamonds bought. I really need to start promoting EDMC in system chat to improve the community data coverage.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T10:22:53Z Started mining with PMC Miner 3.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T12:48:53Z PMC PapaBear LTD buy order was fulfilled, a cmdr called me a "prick!" in system chat as I advertised buying but there was nothing to sell when he docked, even though I clearly spammed that only 177t demand left that hurry up. This is the problem on dealing with people, you always get the idiots, most people are fucking idiots.
</p>

<p>
I think in a long run... I wont be doing this, meaning keeping system chat open, helping CMDR's and buying/selling and taxiing CMDR's to sell systems. I'll just go back to my pre fleet carriers era of playing in solo with system chat turned OFF. No discord, no interaction with idiots.
</p>

<p>
My life is really relaxed, I am laid back happy relaxed dude, but these idiots really get me angry as they are so fucking stupid and cant fucking read etc, some are even plain out trolls bullshitting me and bad mouthing PMC name. Why the fuck would I want to hang around in surroundings as that.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Plotted route for PMC PapaBear to nearby jamanu system as sell system was full of carriers.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T12:59:50Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer is full, oh my that was great! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear got 13t donated LTDs. I created LTD sell order for 3749t at 1.548 million per ton.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T13:20:34Z PMC Wanderer jump plotted to nearby jamanu system, jamanu itself was again full, I did manage to jump PMC PapaBear there though.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer cargo is 20,314t of LTDs hehe wow 20k bitches! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After just saying those dealing with idiots things above, now I feel really good as I'm departing to selling system and offering there very cool 100k profits for traders and would be fucking crazy if someone would shit talk PMC there.
</p>

<p>
If the selling goes nicely and I can do another so successful mining buying round, that would be great, after that we would have enough cash to fill whole 23k of carriers cargo hold, then we would be fully bulk trading heh.
</p>

<p>
One thing is for sure, I will not be doing any manual labor myself anymore, ZERO trading in selling system and only mining would be done as recreational fun.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T13:35:20Z Docked at Hyades Sector AQ-N b7-6/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrived, only got whopping 2t of LTD donations, oh well.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T13:51:37Z PMC PapaBear was selling LTDs for 1.548 million per ton and the shit was just flying off the cargo racks. I only got into the system and refreshed EDDB and supply had gone from original 3,749t to 2400t and once I loaded commodities market up after docking it was already down to 1,725t. Maaan this stuff goes like crazy.
</p>

<p>
What a difference from yesterday, oh wow. Okay so mark down the time now because that MUST have something to do with it as well, so sunday 13:30hrs UTC. Obviously sundays are always really busy so that might be it too. Maybe its the no bulk tax price and just overall good / lucky system selection, previously we were in systems with completely dead chat.
</p>

<p>
Well I cant complain as carrier gets emptied like the Lord Of War movies weapon laden aircraft in afrika hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:06:59Z Unfuckingbelievable, PMC PapaBear is sold out, all 3749t of LTDs! Amazing!
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:14:31Z PMC Wanderer arrived, announced the 20,314t LTD selling at 1.548 million per ton. Now lets see how fast that goes.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:26:05Z Hmm maybe PMC PapaBear selling was one time fluke, still nothing not a single diamond sold yet...
</p>

<p>
There was another carrier, by the star so 400+ ls away, which was selling its 8000t load for 1.5 million, not sure what the exact amount is because technically I'm selling at the same price too... except higher if he really sells 1.500 them.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:34:24Z PMC PapaBear created LTDs buy order for 4008t at 1.448 million per ton.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:39:40Z Selling has started, supply now 19,908t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T14:49:52Z Supply 19,294t. It seems to go very slowly like one single trader hauling, there definitely ain't more than two small cargo ships doing it now. Of course everything needs to be in context, yesterday ALL DAY didn't sell shit, today only sell few hundred in ten minutes heh.
</p>

<p>
BTW strange thing, PMC PapaBear was updated on EDDN even though I do not run any tool in PMC DevSurf.
</p>

<p>
Supply down to:
</p>

<pre>
2020-07-12T14:56:21Z 18,568t.
2020-07-12T15:13:07Z 17,442t.
2020-07-12T15:16:22Z 16,508t.
2020-07-12T15:20:53Z 15,382t.
2020-07-12T15:35:23Z 13,374t. Another big carrier finished its sales, probably few more traders come to my way now.
2020-07-12T15:42:46Z 12,584t.
2020-07-12T15:45:56Z 11,584t. Yes definitely the other carriers departure expedited our sales.
2020-07-12T15:53:38Z 11,072t.
2020-07-12T16:00:01Z 9,893t. And sure enough at this time some imbecile commented that I'm not exactly paying premium with this 100,000cr per ton profit, hah.
2020-07-12T16:03:13Z Couple of CMDR's, even the above commenter, announced they will join the hauling. I assume now the shit really flys off the cargo racks.
2020-07-12T16:08:13Z 7,357t.
2020-07-12T16:16:26Z 5,395t.
2020-07-12T16:18:32Z 3,413t. I actually had to double check so during that small time dialog was closed, supply dropped again heh.
2020-07-12T16:20:21Z 2,997t.
2020-07-12T16:25:18Z 1,153t.
</pre>

<p>
2020-07-12T16:27:18Z PMC Wanderer sold out, all 20,314t of diamonds! Whohhoo! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then I plotted a jump to col 285 LTD 3 rings, gotta get back to mining end of this loop <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I am really happy now, feeling good to have both carriers sold out in record time. This is awesome. I just still wonder what part does sunday primetime EU playing time have with this and how much it is that crazy 100k per ton profit for traders hmm.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T16:33:30Z Then it was lunch break time...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T17:02:42Z Feeding over, back to mining. PMC Wanderer credit balance 32.608 billion hehe, cool.
</p>

<p>
Created LTD buy order for 21,716t at usual 1.448 million per ton. Darn didn't get the full capacity of the carrier but very close, next loop we will max out the carrier capacity with a buy order heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T17:34:21Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear LTD demand was down to 3884t, hmm so quickly, I havent even advertised it anywhere heh. Checked eddb and it was not listed but on inara it was, so that must be it.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T17:40:05Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, took a quick break here but 20min after there was 410t LTDs sold here, nice start. Then I went off to mining with PMC Miner 2 again, gotta exploit that SLF thing until wednesdays most likely fix.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T18:14:46Z Started mining at "The Egg".
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T20:26:37Z All full, we are RTB.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T20:31:00Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. Sold 704t cargo and 8t refinery bins to PMC Wanderer, so ... to myself... umm, yes? HUH WHA? <img src="images/smileys/icon_eek.gif" alt="Smiley :bender-eyes:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-12T21:15:30Z Lunch break finished, back to mining I guess and advertising PMC carriers. Wanderer is now 15,419t and PapaBear 544t, pretty good but I wouldn't mind if it sped up a bit now.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-13 LTD Market Prices Crashed, Again</h2>

<p>
2020-07-13T00:09:35Z Cargo almost full of diamonds, limpets expired just after I abandoned the rest in cargo heh, so almost full.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T00:15:35Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear sold some diamonds there, now is full.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T00:19:39Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-5/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer sold rest of the LTDs here, still 11k demand left, ways to go.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-13T00:51:44Z Felt not tired or exhausted, but kind of like <i>"hmm don't really want to continue mining.."</i> and then alarm went off on phone that 16hrs is up, oh right time to call it a night then <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC DevSurf: PMC PapaBear jumped to hyades sectorwhatever system, I created LTD sell order for 4011t at 1.548 million per ton. Tried and got a carrier slot for jamanu 1 so plotted jump there, great. Then shut down Elite client for second account.
