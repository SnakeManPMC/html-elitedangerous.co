<p>2016-09-06T01:32:54Z departed from Jameson Memorial.
</p>

<p>At this time in my EliteLog tool I had hyper jumped 15,609 times. It will be really interesting to see how many jumps I'm going to do in this journey before I return to Jameson Memorial again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-09-06T01:34:00Z plotted course and jumped to Ipmil system, PMC Galaxy Loop has BEGUN!, AGAIN! HAHA <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-09-06T09:58:36Z arrived to Pro Eurk KX-L d7-16, which was the system where I got my ship destroyed.
</p>

<p>2016-09-06T10:50:18Z arrived to Prue Dryai EB-U d4-37 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 03.
</p>

<p>2016-09-06T20:23:07Z arrived to Thraikooe VS-U d2-34 system which is PMC Galaxy Loop leg 04.
</p>

<p>Made a new high score of hyperspace jumps in one session today! Old one was 567 jumps which was made on my galactic core return trip.
</p>

<p>It was quite exhausting task to break that record. As you can see I started UTC 0132hrs, but I took a small (hour+?) nap sometime in the morning time, was just somehow so tired, but after that I pressed on all day and to the night.
</p>

<p>I believe the record I'm making now is quite tough to break, sure you can do it when you really focus and motivate yourself, get very good like 8hrs sleep and then go crazy right from the morning until you crash to bed again. It can be done heh, but it will be very tough <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-09-06T22:51:25Z arrived to Ellorps PI-M a62-0 system, this was todays 600th jump! New record! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Decided to call it a day here, even number new record and it has been extremely long and exhausting day hyper space jumping that many times. I was 24,536Ly from Sol.
