	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

2020-06-29T12:37:57Z Well CMDR Snake Man PMC and PMC PapaBear's adventures came to an end when we encountered the bug where carrier flys away very fast in normal space. Eventually you can catch it, but cannot land on it as the landing pads are "offset", you land properly but... it doesn't activate docking as I assume game thinks you are not aligned to landing pad properly.

<p>
Yep, its just second account, throwaway "just for fun" thing in the first place so decided to clear the save. I would have so much stupid tritium mining grind before reaching the bubble that I would have gone crazy. I bet if I'll try to do start from zero mining into fleet carrier it would not take more than like a week maybe five days dunno.
</p>

<p>
I did have sentimental attachment for PMC PapaBear, PMC Miner 3 and even the type-7 mining ship, a lot of work was done with those ships, but hey what can you do with game bugs like that and me not having the patience to wait more than a week for possible fix from frontier support tickets. And I was already planning on clearing save to get back to the bubble quicker.
</p>

<p>
This was very easy decision, will I regret it in the morning? Who knows.
