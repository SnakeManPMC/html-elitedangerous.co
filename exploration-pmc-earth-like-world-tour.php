<section>
	<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
My name is CMDR Snake Man, this is a late 2018 exploration story about visiting all my previously discovered earth like worlds (ELW) and surface probe scannig them after Elite Dangerous v3.3 Beyond exploration update changes.
</p>

<p>
This story was written as it happened, using <a href="https://github.com/SnakeManPMC/elite-EliteLog" target="_blank">Elite Log</a> a lot to record event times, system names etc.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-07</h2>

<p>
2018-12-07T21:26:03Z departed from Jameson Memorial <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-08T09:46:10Z woke up and started playing, last night reached Sifaea RY-S d3-132 system which is 5183ly from sol.
</p>

<p>
At start my distance to destination was 6443ly and route plotted shows 109 jumps (realistic plot filtering).
</p>

<p>
30min 35 jumps, distance traveled 2073ly (remaining 4370ly).
</p>

<p>
Jump times with normal exploration fuel scooping 54.3sec, 51.7sec, 51.9sec, 54.1sec.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-09</h2>

<p>
2018-12-09T18:51:54Z landed on 17,682km radius ice world with 1.82 gravity, didn't touch down on the ground but just flew 15km above the surface after extremely cautious and low angle approach. That planet was HUGE.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-09T22:19:16Z Oofairg IC-D d12-94 7, Water world, thick argon rich atmosphere, water geysers volcanism, Radius: 18891.1 km, my new highscore radius <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-09T22:45:12Z Oofairg NI-B d13-97 10, Ammonia world, thick atmosphere, water geysers volcanism, Radius: 16207.7 km, my new highscore radius.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-10</h2>

<p>
2018-12-10T14:02:07Z back in my good old Asp cockpit, the last day of old school exploration commences...
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is 173 jumps away in about 10,125ly distance, lets see if I can make it there today.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-10T21:39:08Z arrived at Dryeae Auwsy UM-W d1-121 system. This was nice steady medium speed traveling, 7h 30min roughly for 10,125ly. I'm now 33,785.07ly from Sol.
</p>

<p>
In this route plotting found 3 ammonia, 1 earth like and 28 water worlds.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-11 Elite Dangerous v3.3 Beyond</h2>

<p>
2018-12-11T00:08:19Z arrived at Hypo Aoc MC-D d12-21 system as I wanted to explore a little bit more. Thats 37,129.84ly from sol.
</p>

<p>
With these new exploration jumps I did total 231 jumps today, scanned 158 objects, found 4 ammonia, 1 earth like and 38 water worlds. Smallest scanned body radius was 259km landable, largest 77,497km (gas giant).
</p>

<p>
2018-12-11T17:00:00Z Elite Dangerous v3.3 Beyond was released.
</p>

<p>
Servers were hammered, I actually got the update downloaded real quickly like within 2 minutes and then got to play for maybe 10min until the servers started to fail as more and more commanders were downloading and playing. Then I had to stop because for over an hour I could not get a working server. Continued playing like 2200hrs and then after midnight the servers started to work.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-12</h2>

<p>
2018-12-12T19:55:56Z was playing again after doing some C++ coding fixes for Elite Log, had the servers go down on me again (no pun intended). It was quite a long wait for servers being unavailable, usually when there are issues the servers let you in but then you lose connection or something, now I had to sit on my hands just waiting when the red "cant connect" was on main menu.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-14</h2>

<p>
2018-12-14T06:33:51Z Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 37, special planets ammonia: 1, water: 4, planets smallest: 283.262km, largest: 77751.1km, detail surface scans: 487
</p>

<p>
2018-12-14T21:20:42Z started to head 3.8k ly away to trojans belt sector.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-14T22:53:18Z arrived at Hypi Chroa BA-O b20-0 system in trojan belt region.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-15 Earth Like World Tour Is Born</h2>

<p>
2018-12-15T01:04:06Z started to go through my local notes about earth like world discoveries also ammonia and water worlds. I was really surprised to see so many of the systems still having undiscovered bodies and I found even one with undiscovered water world as back then I did not recognize them from system map hehe.
</p>

<p>
So I decided that hey, I'm going for an epic journey of visiting all my old earth like world systems and surface mapping probe them, plus the rest of the system obviously with Full Spectrum Scanner (FSS), especially that missed water world.
</p>

<p>
Now this will be huge journey as the locations are all over the galaxy, but it will be journey with a purpose and if I don't do it now most likely later the system have been surface mapped already.
</p>

<p>
So I started to place bookmarks for galaxy map for all the earth like worlds. I doubt I'll go through water worlds as there are SO many of them, I'm good with earth like worlds.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T02:48:53Z all done for the galaxy map bookmarks, now I just needed to decide how should I proceed because I'm not sure bolting to nearest waypoint is the overall best course of action. If I look at the big picture it might be better to follow the <a href="pmc-galaxy-loop.php" target="_blank">PMC Galaxy Loop</a> route counter clockwise hmm not sure.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T03:42:45Z after a long consideration I decided to go like PMC Galaxy Loop counter clockwise which would feel like a new thing, then either dock at populated space at south end of the route or keep going through Snake Sector into galaxy core from where I would return to my starting location and clockwise loop back to populated space.
</p>

<p>
I would estimate that this route would roughly be 210,000ly <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T03:48:13Z started from Hypi Chroa LI-K d8-9 system! HERE WE GO! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T07:57:56Z arrived at Weqea BZ-H c23-46 system in The Veils sector.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T08:24:13Z arrived at Bleethuia PU-V d3-136, which is our bookmark 1.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T09:29:38Z after scanning the system shut elite down, uuh its been a long day baby...
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T09:30:45Z (after 13hrs exploring) Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 243, special planets earthlike: 5, water: 16, planets smallest: 530.3km, largest: 75980.4km, detail surface scans: 963
</p>

<p>
2018-12-15T19:00:36Z woke up and back at my Asp cockpit, time to head towards next waypoint in our earth like world revisit tour <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This system is Pru Chroa Jc-c B13-6 which is very far 13,830.35 ly away, total of 230 hyper jumps (using non scoopable filter) whoah that is quite the hop.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-16</h2>

<p>
2018-12-16T01:17:00Z crossed into Formorian Frontier sector.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-16T01:59:45Z arrived at Pru Chroa JC-C b13-6 system which is bookmark 2.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is 13,312.69 ly and 233 hyper jumps away, uuh these distances are killing me hehe. Well you knew the magnitude when you signed up for this shit so shut the hell up <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to scan few systems now and relax, as the previous waypoint was all jumping only to stop scanning the usual special planets.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-16T04:32:20Z called it for a night. Quite weak, only played 11hrs or so, but have to do some chores before sleeping tonight so better get a head start on those before I get tired.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 254, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 2, water: 23, planets smallest: 362.323km, largest: 77380.9km, detail surface scans: 1222
</p>

<p>
Distance to Sol: 50,935.95 ly
</p>

<p>
2018-12-16T20:09:54Z started exploring for today.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-16T23:11:21Z arrived at Blo Chroa GB-L b35-0 system. Felt just absolutely gutless and very tired which is amazing considering I slept 8h 48min last night, this must be some major sleep depravation cycle filling up or something heh. Had to go take a nap so shut down PMC Gaming computer as I really do not want to leave it burning electricity while I just sleep.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 69, special planets ammonia: 3, water: 14, planets smallest: 187.592km, largest: 76668km, detail surface scans: 358
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-17</h2>

<p>
2018-12-17T01:29:25Z nap time over back in Asp cockpit, plotted route to the next waypoint which currently is about 7.8k ly away.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T04:02:26Z at Byaa Broae ND-K d8-6 system found 21,395km radius ammonia world, my own highscore.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T06:10:09Z arrived at Choi Eork PL-F c14-0 system and found third (3) water world discovered by another CMDR, oh man this is getting old.
</p>

<p>
I'm pissed off because Elite Log registers that as discovered special planet, but its not, its tainted by the stink of another CMDR <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T06:32:21Z arrived at Choi Eork GL-W c18-0 system just in THE ABYSS sector <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T08:36:23Z arrived at Eishav MO-K c11-0 system which is bookmark 3.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is 4,707.63 ly away. Not very far, but this area so close to beagle point or at least the route to beagle point is heavily traveled by other CMDRs and every other system has been discovered. I really do not want to be here... can't wait to get this next earth like world cleared and then get the hell out of here.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T11:36:42Z arrived at Syre Thua OD-Z c27-1 system which is bookmark 4. This was 64,136.13 ly from sol. Horrible place as almost every system was discovered by CMDR, all I wanted to do is get the hell outta here <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then I plotted my course towards the next waypoint, due "south west". There will be the void between spiral arms, not sure if I can make it through with my 61.57 ly jump range PMC Explorer Asp. If not, I'll use jumponium and manual plotting.
</p>

<p>
The next waypoint was about 18k ly away but route plotter could not plot route.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T12:41:16Z arrived at Puwee LE-A b55-0 system and decided to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 259, special planets ammonia: 3, earthlike: 3, water: 19, planets smallest: 376.274km, largest: 77425.3km, detail surface scans: 1430, however I visited two earth like worlds which were done by me and several water worlds done by other CMDRs before I started to avoid those.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T22:13:30Z woke up and back in Asp cockpit, lets continue towards our current destination.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-17T22:53:16Z was returning from <a href="https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/2146320/name/Pyrie+Eurk+TQ-G+c10-1" target="_blank">Pyrie+Eurk+TQ-G+c10-1</a> towards "south west" and every frigging system was discovered by CMDRs <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It is completely ridiculous what kind of tourist spot kindergarden the beagle point has become, which includes the route there and back roughly towards the core. I will never ever come back here as here is nothing for me to do as its so badly tainted by other CMDRs. I accept nothing but undiscovered systems!
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-18</h2>

<p>
2018-12-18T06:43:16Z arrived at Thuechao KW-A b47-1 system and decided to call it a night. Wasn't really tired but again good to do some chores and other stuff once in a while heh.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 220, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 3, water: 17, planets smallest: 370.772km, largest: 76907.4km, detail surface scans: 1026
</p>

<p>
8hrs elite session, pretty okay but nothing to celebrate about. I just wanted to relax a bit rest of the day, didn't feel like pushing that hyper jumping which is now already quite boring.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-18T22:17:55Z woke up and started playing.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-19 Elite Dangerous v3.3.01 Upgrade</h2>

<p>
2018-12-19T06:16:17Z arrived at Wruethoi WD-T c3-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was very close only 740ly away.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T06:32:27Z arrived at Bya Freau AW-H b51-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was even closer, mere 296ly away. A lot of earth like worlds here heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T06:44:49Z arrived at Bya Freau CB-F d11-5 system which is my ELW bookmark. Third and last on this close area.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 5128ly away, not too far but takes 87 jumps on realistic plotting, most likely going to use good stars filter which extends it to 90, not too bad.
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-12-19T10:27:42Z Elite Dangerous v3.3.01 upgrade</b>, galaxy servers went down.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T11:28:55Z arrived at Glaitaei TN-K c8-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is whopping 11,029ly away, quite hop indeed.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T13:57:35Z was in Myoangua GR-N d6-150 system and scanned two water worlds, that concluded my todays elite session, its been a long damn day heh.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 301, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 7, water: 36, planets smallest: 385.983km, largest: 77189.8km, detail surface scans: 1689. This stat includes at least two sets of earth like and water worlds which I already had discovered last year.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T21:24:55Z woke up and back in Asp cockpit, lets continue our journey towards the current waypoint.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-19T22:27:42Z at Schignua LF-A c25 system was starting to surface map a water world, approached it like any other of the hundreds I've done so far using the 7 second rule, when got to surface scanner range I had a brain fart, I activated the scanner before I pulled throttle back and before I had time to react to shut down the scanner and steer clear of the water world... boom I crashed into the exclusion zone and dropped out of super cruise. Took 1% damage to hull and all internal modules got 2% heh. Must have been some early morning before breakfast brain failure indeed.
</p>

<p>
Oh well now I have story to tell how I crashed into a planet <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-20</h2>

<p>
2018-12-20T00:00:57Z arrived at Vegnio ZD-K d8-127 system which had, get this, ringed water world of 21,653km radius AND ringed earth like world! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I decided to surface map all the terraformables in this system, it was fairly large system so didn't want to commit to surface map everything. Unless I'm mistaken this is only the second ringed earth like world and the water world is one of the largest I have discovered. Edit: it was just the next ELW waypoint that had ringed one as well, was this the first one I mentioned or am I forgetting all the discoveries already hehe.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T01:14:36Z arrived at Sphuqia YL-L c21-6 system, felt really tired like didn't get enough sleep last night so decided to take a nap (and shut down PMC Gaming computer).
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 121, special planets ammonia: 2, earthlike: 1, water: 12, planets smallest: 471.1km, largest: 76323.9km, detail surface scans: 543.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T07:04:10Z oops forgot to write down when I woke up from nap and continued playing, but this time had to shut elite down due usual thursday morning background simulation server update.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T07:25:08Z arrived at Hypua Groa SU-V d3-117 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 12,511ly away, 209 jumps with good filtering.
</p>

<p>
Today I was thinking that this dec 7th started exploration journey without a purpose was again meant to be just relaxing exploration which turned into something else (re-visit ELW's) so dunno what to say anymore as it always seems to happen heh. Right now I'm again thinking that "when this journey is over then I'm going out to explore just to FSS every system body and not be hurry to get anywhere specic" hehe.
</p>

<p>
Yeah I would like to FSS everything, to be thorough, but if you look at my current planned route... it would take months and months to complete as whole system FSS takes so long time and there are thousands of systems to go through.
</p>

<p>
Also I already worry that for example the drymans point codex reported earth like world will be stolen by some CMDR before I get to sell my data, I am really surprised nobody has done it yet, just checked nervously, still undiscovered.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-20T08:31:19Z was in Oushaist VO-T c6-1 system, finished scanning ammonia world... and I was bored, had to stop playing because it was a struggle. Time to watch some TV until I feel the urge to play elite again, I would assume this could be as earliest as later today but perhaps tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 48, special planets ammonia: 2, earthlike: 1, water: 4, planets smallest: 396.506km, largest: 76923.5km, detail surface scans: 528.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-21</h2>

<p>
2018-12-21T11:54:08Z started playing after relaxing in front of a tv for a while. Today my plan was to play just a little bit maybe 10 perhaps 20 jumps because I had to start up PMC Gaming once today.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-21T12:32:30Z shut elite down, like said this was just a quick play time.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 23, special planets water: 1, planets smallest: 581.876km, largest: 71589.8km, detail surface scans: 115.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-24 Merry Christmas</h2>

<p>
2018-12-24T01:49:56Z started elite after a two days break. Lets explore <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It felt good to be back in my Asp cockpit in other side of the galaxy exploring, last two days was spent watching tv which was indeed good break from elite but it was good to take a few days breather as I've been playing every day since dec 7th I think.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T03:37:28Z checked my codex first reported discovery of drymans point earth like world, still undiscovered. Guess nobody is interested of stealing that discovery as its been already over a week.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T04:09:02Z had to call it quits as I was falling a sleep in front of the computer. Only slept like 6hrs last night and now felt super tired.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 56, special planets ammonia: 2, earthlike: 2, water: 9, planets smallest: 386.302km, largest: 71373.4km, detail surface scans: 333.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T08:34:16Z back from the nap, lets continue exploring.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T12:28:25Z arrived at Yepai AQ-P d5-128 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1468ly away, just a quick hop.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T13:42:45Z arrived at Hypi Fleau JG-P b19-14 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1807ly away, quite short hops around here, I like it, keeps traveling interesting.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T14:52:01Z arrived at Eolls Priae EP-G c27-3 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1293ly away, nice.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T15:29:12Z arrived at Dryua Flyiae PE-E d13-6 system which is my ELW bookmark. This was the last waypoint in perseus arm, next ones turn into "east" towards colonia.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 10845ly and 183 hyperjumps away, a lot of jumping ahead of me heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T17:53:19Z was really "out of it", not tired at all but just could not concentrate on elite playing, felt really weird so had to stop.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 246, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 2, water: 31, planets smallest: 316.922km, largest: 75975.6km, detail surface scans: 1250.
</p>

	<h2>2018-12-25</h2>

<p>
2018-12-25T04:01:19Z back in Asp cockpit, lets continue towards the core/colonia waypoints.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T09:22:56Z arrived at Ogaiw TS-U d2-108 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint is ridiculously close at mere 390ly, heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T09:45:51Z arrived at Ogaiw ZD-T d3-6 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>
I made the decision NOT to go colonia to sell my exploration data. It is risky as I have the codex first discovery for earth like world in drymans point sector which I'm sure many CMDRs will visit, honestly I'm surprised nobody has got it yet.
</p>

<p>
Started towards the next waypoint is "SW" direction. It was about 12k ly away and route plotter actually could not plot so had to make a pit stop around 6k ly point.

<p>
2018-12-25T13:48:21Z had some connection issues, servers went down due so many players. Then had to replot route and this time got it done to my next waypoint.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-25T16:06:39Z had to call it a night even though I wasnt really sleepy tired yet, just didn't have more energy (patience more accurately) to explore more today.

2018-12-26T10:40:17Z tried few premium FSD injections, ie jumponium which doubled my Asp jump range to like 125ly or something. But that is utter bullshit, totally useless as I can jump with normal plotting two times way faster than jump through all the hoops (no pun intended) necessarily to FSD inject.

</p>

<p>
Today at least in the beginning of the day I'm going to use galaxy map filter realistic as I want to get to my destination as quick as possible. I am willing to sacrifice finding interesting systems and special planets in order to get where I'm going.

</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 3570ly, 60 hyper jumps away, at the galactic plane.
</p>

<p>
On Ploi Aim CK-Y d1-47 went to surface map ammonia world 522,000 ls out heh. Yeah not sure if that is very smart to spend such time traveling to this one planet to just tag your name into the mapped part along with first discovery... not sure...
</p>

<p>
I'm kinda thinking that surface mapping is quite useless, I don't need the credits and besides landable planet with for example geological locations, there is no point of mapping it, only for your name tag. I mean if you have the first discovery, that should be enough.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T18:47:17Z arrived at Blu Aescs IY-L b7-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.

</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T21:19:11Z arrived at Blu Aescs RD-Q d6-8 system which is neutron star and obviously discovered by a CMDR. I wonder what is this area I'm traveling now as so many systems discovered by CMDRs, maybe some dumb "expedition" has traveled through here or something, I mean we aren't that close to core yet.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T21:50:51Z arrived at Blu Aescs OY-Y d1-42 system which is my ELW bookmark. Had water world and few unexplored bodies as well.

<p>
2018-12-27T22:35:09Z arrived at Cyooko VC-V d2-22 system which is my ELW bookmark. This was neutron star system with three water worlds.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T22:51:53Z just almost crashed and burned with the feeling of not wanting to play elite anymore today, I've been playing since 1034hrs so roughly 12hrs, which is quite decent duration for any gaming I think. I would like to play all day but after yesterdays megalomaniac 22hrs and staying awake 23hrs 35min straight I guess this twelve hour set is the best I can do. Now I feel like maybe tomorrow I'll take a day off...

I didn't feel much like doing nothing today, not even playing elite. That is bizarre as day before and yesterday I was almost hyperventilating of how enthusiastic I was to explore... I guess this is the crash and burn thingy now heh. But hey at least I feel like this for everything today not just elite.

</p>

<p>
During this hop I entered into the extremely dense starfield area, it was quite difficult to use FSS as its text is blue and the stars were so bright on the background heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-28T20:42:41Z had to stop playing as got quite exhausted all of the sudden. Maybe this is some bigger burnout for exploration jumping again as I've been doing it almost every day for three weeks now.

</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was far in the "east", total of 20,423ly away where I can't even plot a route. Had to plot one 19.9k ly away which was 323 hyper jumps hehe.

<p>
Actually I would want to finish this journey and return to sell exploration data as quick as possible, but looking at the waypoints ahead of me I can tell that even with hardcore 300+ day hyper jumping it would still take me several days. No, there is no easy fix for this, you just have to do those jumps and travel until you reach home (well doh! hehe).

2019-01-01T00:00:02Z happy new year! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-01-01T00:18:47Z arrived at Oob Chrea LH-Y b28-8 system which is my ELW bookmark. Had several unexplored bodies here, no specials.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 4222ly, 70 hyper jumps away...
</p>

<p>
Except that my Saitek / Logitech X-56 Rhino HOTAS yaw started to pull randomly to the left, even without me touching the stick. This already happened in way smaller scale few days ago, I compensated by increasing the deadzone on the yaw, but today basically around the new year hehe, it broke more or less and kept pulling to the left almost constantly.
</p>

<p>
It pisses me off that X-55 and X-56 are excellent to use, but the production value is garbage, so many issues and failures on these that its ridiculous. I had to return the previous X-55 to warranty and now it seems I have to do the same with this X-56 as well, damnit <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well maybe I'll google the issue tomorrow and ask around on Elite discord, but if nothing comes out of that I guess I need to pack this baby up and return to the store for repair/replacement.
</p>

<p>
2019-01-01T00:27:40Z stopped playing due HOTAS yaw breaking up <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

<p>
2019-01-06T19:28:31Z arrived at Zunoa OZ-L b35-11 system which is my ELW bookmark. Funny thing was that I was just hyper jumping after this few days break and did not pay attention to how many jumps left and all of the sudden I arrived to a system that was already discovered. I was confused that whaaat just happen until I checked system map and, oh, we've arrived hehe.
</p>

<p>
Few unexplored bodies, no specials.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 6240ly, 102 hyper jumps away. I already knew that I was not going to do this hop during this session, just didn't get into the exploration jumping mood for some reason, maybe I was tired dunno.

2019-01-08T15:30:40Z was done selling exploration data, got about 900 million credits. Shut down elite after a looong day of exploring <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 701, special planets ammonia: 8, earthlike: 10, water: 49, planets smallest: 332.197km, largest: 77219.5km, detail surface scans: 2709.
</p>

<p>
I was dead tired and wanted to go to sleep but of course EDMC was uploading still over 7,000 EDDN messages when I was done selling the exploration data. But had to wait until EDMC was done, it was 100 messages to left to send when I heard from the author that yes you can close the program and it will continue nicely on next time you start it. Oh well, got everything uploaded and basically crashed to bed for some well earned rest... <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
