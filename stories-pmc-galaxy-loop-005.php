	<h2>2016-08-22 Flip Flop Engineer</h2>

<p>2016-08-22T19:53:23Z Been keeping casual relaxed pace when exploring, usually do only small like 20 or so systems per day. Like said, very relaxed enjoyable exploring. This is also because I have other things to do daily at the moment, I'm sure once I get more time and v2.2 comes out... we do 200 systems per day! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-08-23T17:07:58Z decided to flip flop completely <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Okay so the Horizons v2.1 The Engineers came out which included possibility to increase FSD jump range, well I watched few youtube videos and talked with other CMDR's on IRC and decided to give it a try, I want to increase my explorer ASP's jump range so navigating near Beagle Point and "outer rim" is easier.
</p>

<p>I was 4061Ly away from Sol and 4191Ly away from Deciat which is engineer bitches home system where I need to go.
</p>

<p>2016-08-23T20:31:26Z arrived to Deciat system, player killer CMDR RedLineUK destroyed my ship. I lost exploration data from 1148 systems since 2016-08-06. BRITISH BLOODY BLIMEY CUNT.
</p>

<p>After this I took a day or so break, then started to work on the engineers FSD upgrade. I wont bore you with the details in this exploration page, but when I was finished my ASP had 51.66Ly jump range, whoah pretty nice huh! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
