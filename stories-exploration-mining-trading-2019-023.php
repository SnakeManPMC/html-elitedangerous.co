	<h2>2019-09-28 Trading With Lakon Type-9</h2>

<p>
2019-09-28T16:16:49Z switched to PMC Trader Lakon Type-9, took off to the TradeDangerous best trading route of the galaxy.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T16:26:32Z docked at 76 Sigma Ceti/Shaw Orbital. Balance 5.331 billion. Bought 790 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics.
</p>

<p>
Wanted adder interdicted me... for like four fucking times, he just kept on coming after each time I submitted and then escaped to supercruise. He even jumped at the station when I was docking but obviously saw the security and bugged out. I don't recall ever seen so enthusiastic killer/pirate <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC Trader hull was 76% status when I docked, it cost me 23.6k repairs.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T16:38:12Z docked at LTT 1349/Lundwall City, sold cargo for 6.124 million profit. Bought 790 x Industrial Materials/Polymers.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T16:50:15Z docked at Dakvar/Port Bueschel, sold cargo for 6.751 million profit.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T17:25:34Z traveled empty and docked to 76 Sigma Ceti/Shaw Orbital, new trade loop begins. I'll stop writing play-by-play because its copy paste stuff and actually takes a while to write, so I'm only going to write if something special happened like interdictions or price drops etc.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T18:10:32Z another trade run completed, balance 5.371 billion.
</p>

<p>
I don't give shit about cR3DiTZ p3r h0uR crap, but I took a quick break to shower and made 40 million in about 1h 44min.
</p>

<p>
Not sure how that compares to mining painite, the loads are so huge like 600t or more and then you make half a billion selling it when the hours spent mining that are like 6hrs.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-28T18:16:02Z anyways, getting pretty tired and its been a good elite day today, so time to call it a night.
