2018-12-27T10:34:29Z back at my Asp cockpit in Jameson Memorial, sold the piece of shit SRV hangar which increased jump range to 62.88ly, nice. Time to head out and finish off the second half of this earth like world galaxy loop <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Today at least in the beginning of the day I'm going to use galaxy map filter realistic as I want to get to my destination as quick as possible. I am willing to sacrifice finding interesting systems and special planets in order to get where I'm going.
</p>

<p>
First waypoint is 694ly, 12 hyper jumps away. Lets do this!
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T10:47:56Z arrived at Swoiwns XO-Y d1-23 system which is my ELW bookmark, right here in the bubble (I think its on bubble, very close).
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1627ly, 28 hyper jumps away.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T11:40:40Z arrived at Bleae Thua CV-X d1-5 system which is my ELW bookmark. Yeah one hyper jump away from that yo-z d0 system with another earth like, heh nice close by thingy.

<p>
2018-12-27T12:45:15Z arrived at Smojue BN-V b44-0 system which was partially discovered by CMDR Chorizo Del Monde, but he missed (by choice?) water world bunch of gas giants and high metal content worlds 405,000 ls away. I'll take them and even go surface mapping the water world <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T13:21:17Z arrived at Traikaae JU-X b15-4 system which had water world discovered by CMDR Grimes.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T14:19:56Z arrived at Ploi Aewsy NC-D c12-10 system which is my ELW bookmark. There was a lot of unexplored bodies in this system, including water world what I'm ashamed to say I did not scan initially when I found this system hehe, noob <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1206ly, 21 hyper jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T15:01:19Z arrived at Plaa Aescs VD-T d3-195 system which is my ELW bookmark. Few unexplored icy worlds here and water world as well.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 916ly, 16 hyper jumps away. This was 772ly above the galactic plane.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T15:30:12Z arrived at Plaa Aescs DI-I d10-30 system which is my ELW bookmark. Also water world and few unexplored bodies.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T16:39:22Z arrived at Pru Aescs QF-Z c16-1 system which is my ELW bookmark. Also water world, another undiscovered(!) one and few less interesting bodies.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 3570ly, 60 hyper jumps away, at the galactic plane.
</p>

<p>
On Ploi Aim CK-Y d1-47 went to surface map ammonia world 522,000 ls out heh. Yeah not sure if that is very smart to spend such time traveling to this one planet to just tag your name into the mapped part along with first discovery... not sure...
</p>

<p>
I'm kinda thinking that surface mapping is quite useless, I don't need the credits and besides landable planet with for example geological locations, there is no point of mapping it, only for your name tag. I mean if you have the first discovery, that should be enough.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T18:47:17Z arrived at Blu Aescs IY-L b7-0 system which is my ELW bookmark.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T20:13:06Z arrived at Bleae Aewsy VL-K d9-14 system which had earth like and water world discovered by CMDR Brimstone Avm.
</p>

<p>
BTW I do not scan these other CMDR discovered special planets, at all.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T21:16:57Z arrived at Bleae Aewsy NI-B c16-0 system which was discovered by three different CMDRs, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T21:19:11Z arrived at Blu Aescs RD-Q d6-8 system which is neutron star and obviously discovered by a CMDR. I wonder what is this area I'm traveling now as so many systems discovered by CMDRs, maybe some dumb "expedition" has traveled through here or something, I mean we aren't that close to core yet.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T21:50:51Z arrived at Blu Aescs OY-Y d1-42 system which is my ELW bookmark. Had water world and few unexplored bodies as well.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Few unexplored bodies here too.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was only 824ly, 14 hyper jumps away but it was 1423ly above galactic plane.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T22:35:09Z arrived at Cyooko VC-V d2-22 system which is my ELW bookmark. This was neutron star system with three water worlds.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-27T22:51:53Z just almost crashed and burned with the feeling of not wanting to play elite anymore today, I've been playing since 1034hrs so roughly 12hrs, which is quite decent duration for any gaming I think. I would like to play all day but after yesterdays megalomaniac 22hrs and staying awake 23hrs 35min straight I guess this twelve hour set is the best I can do. Now I feel like maybe tomorrow I'll take a day off...
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 328, special planets ammonia: 4, earthlike: 12, water: 21, planets smallest: 364.108km, largest: 76593.7km, detail surface scans: 1510. Note that earth likes are duped from the bookmark locations, they arent really a NEW discoveries.
