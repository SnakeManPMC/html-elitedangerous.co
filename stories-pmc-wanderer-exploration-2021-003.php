<p>
2021-03-31T01:27:09Z New Elite day has started, we continue flying PMC Wanderer closer to our destination. Should be less than 30 jumps left.
</p>

<p>
We are in Byae Ail OY-N b21-1 system, here I donated 116t tritium to fuel depot before plotting the next jump.

<p>
Then it was time for a little bit of exploration on PMC Exlorer as, I'm so bored of just sitting here jumping especially as twitch live streams ended, or rather my interest for that awful odyssey dancing & frag garbage. I just need to explore some.
</p>

<p>
Dumped 1000t tritium to fuel depot, then switched over to PMC Explorer, plot a next jump for PMC Wanderer and then took off to explore. I let PMC Wanderer to jump ahead of me while I travel galaxy map route filter as OBAF type star systems, those seem to pick up a lot of nice astronomical bodies in there. Also I use economic plotting, so more jumps.
</p>

<p>
After dozen or so jumps I realized economic route plotting is way too slow, carrier just speds off leaving me behind even without me scanning many special planets, so switched back to fastest route plotting.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-31T05:39:45Z I'm bored and hungry, going to shut down elite, no idea if its for good on today or will I continue after relaxing a bit.
</p>
