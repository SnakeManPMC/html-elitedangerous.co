	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

	<h2>2020-06-27 Tritium Mining</h2>

<p>
2020-06-27T19:23:31Z New Elite day has started, I believe its straight off to tritium mining as thats where I left off last night.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T21:17:31Z Got first like 170t load of tritium mined, plotted new PMC PapaBear jump and... then was so tired had to take a nap.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-27T23:00:04Z Elite back up, lets continue. CMDR Daceton that stowaway we found yesterday is online again. Hopefully we can get some mining done.
</p>

<p>
We got 75t of tritium fuel in the tank. Wow its a long way to mine until its topped off, or even for two jumps.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-28</h2>

<p>
2020-06-28T01:15:41Z Super hungry, had 152t of tritium mined and I decided to take a lunch break. Going to shut down Elite to enjoy my meal in peace.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T01:40:18Z Lunch break is over. Lets dock to PMC PapaBear, offload tritium cargo and plot our next jump.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T02:19:39Z Dropped to Byooe Aescs QF-A c5 A 4 b ring and started to mine.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T03:56:18Z Again dead tired, need to take a nap heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T06:40:32Z Nap over, Elite back up, we continue.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T08:07:45Z Finished mining, it was pretty slow with laser mining type-7 but a nice change to the sub surface type-9. Got 125t tritium and 4 LTDs. Its time to refuel PMC PapaBear.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T08:14:03Z Docked at Byooe Aescs QF-A c5/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear has now 352t of fuel left.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T08:34:23Z Docked at Blia Aescs TW-A c27-0/KNX-T6F. Went to prospect icy rings, no hotspots at all. PMC PapaBear has now 221t fuel left.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T10:03:53Z Found tritium hotspot in Blia Aescs OU-X c14-10, called carrier here and started mining using type-9 sub surface deposit miner.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T11:57:40Z Ran out of sub surface deposit missiles. Found an awesome location with bunch of high content asteroids. Coords are tritium hotspot 70.9km, planet 0.45ls, bromellite 0.52ls, alexandrite 0.64ls, tritium 0.76ls and LTD 0.80ls. This location was the larger tritium hotspot.
</p>

<p>
Got 306t tritium mined, pretty decent load but only half of the cargo capacity so if this is the norm for tritium... hmm I might as well run it with type-7 which is faster.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T12:06:17Z Docked at Blia Aescs OU-X c14-10/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear now has 365t of fuel.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T13:07:28Z Had to call end to current mining session, just felt overly exhausted.
