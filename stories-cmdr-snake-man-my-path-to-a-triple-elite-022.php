<p>2015-11-23T01:35:16Z: decided to go check out Compromised Navigation Beacon's as forum posts say that they are filled with deadly/elite ships. I collected quick list of nav beacons from forums which I plan to visit to see what they are all about.
<br><br>
So I purchased taxi Hauler and headed to Jameson Memorial to pickup my populated space ASP Explorer.</p>

<p>2015-11-23T06:37:16Z: completed tour of those compromised navigation beacons with my ASP. They look very juicy, lot of elite ships there <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
<br><br>
Too bad I didn't yet find any such beacons in A Lavigny-Duval control systems where the 20% bounty passive bonus is applied.</p>

<p>2015-11-23T10:42:12Z: last stop at LTT 2667, where I finished my compromised navigation beacon a lavigny-duval control systems search, there is none <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>2015-11-23T10:46:53Z: returned my ASP to Shinrarta Dezhra, Jameson Memorial. Today no combat ranking unfortunately, all day was spent basically on futile attempt of finding compromised navigation beacon in ALD space. Although I got good data collected, none actually worked as I planned. Oh well, gotta do some compromised navigation beacon bounty hunting without the 20% passive bonus.</p>
