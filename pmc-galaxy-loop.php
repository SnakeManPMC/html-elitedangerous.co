<h1><b>PMC Elite Dangerous, PMC Galaxy Loop</b></h1>
<p>Epic journey to exploration through the milky way galaxy!</p>

<p><b>PMC Exploration Galaxy Loop</b></p>

<p>After reaching Triple Elite status, switch to a relax mode in elite universe and go to an great long journey exploring around the galaxy. Loop clockwise at the "middle" part of galaxy all the way through to the other side of galaxy (from Sol), then get as far in the edge of galaxy as you can jump with current jump capability. From there its so cool to look back at Sol and see the stupid long distance. When done marveling the galaxy, return to the loop route and return to Sol.</p>

<p>Relaxed exploration, no hurry at all. SCAN ALL INTERESTING LOOKING PLANETS, scan all stars, skip useless belts/icy/rock stuff of course. Try to scan the area where youre at for interesting stars. Just enjoy the journey and dont be bothered to count how many Ly did you jump today etc.</p>

<p>My path to triple elite showed in exploration part how easy it is to burn out by playing too much. Don't play every day unless huge enthusiasm strikes. It is very important not to burn out playing too much, trying to jump too many systems at one go/day etc. Try to relax, enjoy the galaxy, if you don't feel like playing then DON'T. Simple.</p>

<p>- Forum topic tracking location?<br>
- Video daily diaries, or at least weekly summarys?<br>
- Web page journey diaries or something similar like sag-a* trip?<br>
- Dont let people know where will you go so no player killer could come to ambush you.<br>
- Important elite upgrades like panther clipper might fuck up your exploration focus, how to handle?</p>

<p>In-game chat Athanasius said that its roughly 2 * 25500 * 3.14 == 160,140Ly journey ;)</p>
