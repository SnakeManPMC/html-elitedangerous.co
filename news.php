2025-06-03T06:00:44Z Finally after dragging my feet FOR MONTHS, it was time to get my act together and release all the new mainly stories page updates for my Elite Dangerous website. Sorry for it taking so long, even today I spent well over an hour just thinking about it before pushing the big red button.
</p>

<p>
<a href="stories.php">Elite Dangerous Stories</a> index page created, all previous stories have been split into more shorter easier to read "day pages", all new stories I've already written but not yet released will appear in that stories page.

<p>
Enjoy.

2025-05-29T00:22:16Z This news web page has been running since beginning of this website, but right now I finished splitting up <a href="news-2015.php">news from 2015 page</a> and write bunch of relevant info to this page you're reading now. It will be my goal just like in <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org/news.php" target="_blank">Farming Simulator news</a> page to write up on all website and other big updates into this page. So if you ever wanted to be fully up to date on latest news on elitedangerous.net website and what I'm doing, always check <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum</a> and this news web page.

<p>
2025-04-30 Frontier announces Panther Clipper MKII will be coming to Elite Dangerous and released sometime 2025.
</p>

<p>
2025-02-27 Just returned to Elite Dangerous after a long 5 year break since 2020 july Elite v3.7 patch 3 update which broke Low Temperature Diamonds (LTD) mining and tritium for fleet carrier fuel usage. I had to come back (even though I knew about terrible odyssey GUI) when I learned about trailblazers update which brings system colonization to Elite. Man I gotta tell ya, I was like fish out of the water when starting to play elite today after five (5) year break, as even five months break would be a quite while, not to mention YEARS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2025-02-26 Elite Dangerous v4.1 Trailblazers update was released! This is the system colonization update.
</p>


	<h2>2021</h2>

<p>
2021-03-21 Tried to play some Elite as its been relaxed goal of mine to steadily play at least a little bit every year (I think year 2017 might have been one exception, at least I have no documentation from that year), however this had to be done in Elite Dangerous Horizons game version because odyssey has the hideous unusable galaxy map and system map GUI. In the end I couldn't play more than few days, you can see details from <a href="stories.php">stories</a> page.
</p>

<p>
2021-05-18 Elite Dangerous Odyssey is released. Frontier Developments reworked galaxy map and system map graphical user interface (GUI), it is now horrible, what were these people thinking. I could not play Elite anymore with this piece of trash GUI <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>


	<h2>2020</h2>

<p>
Summer of 2020 had the crazy Low Temperature Diamonds (LTD) mining craze and Elite Dangerous Fleet Carriers got released.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-09 Elite Dangerous v3.7 <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fleet-carriers-update-patch-notes.546958/" target="_blank">Update Notes</a>, this is the Fleet Carriers release version. Not to be confused with "elite v3.7 patch 3" which destroyed LTD mining and tritium for carrier fuel.
</p>

	<h2>2016</h2>

<p>
2016-10-28T12:16:11Z elitedangerous.net domain registered by PMC. Honestly I have like no recollection from this domain registration, I thought it was done earlier on 2015 because I do remember writing notes about Elite when C++ programming EliteLog tool for example, but perhaps those were just for my local notes which then got transferred to this website you are reading now.
</p>


	<h2>2015</h2>

<p>
Please head over to specific <a href="news-2015.php">News 2015 page</a> to read news bits from the year 2015.
</p>


	<h2>2014</h2>

<p>
2014-12-16 Elite Dangerous is officially released! <a href="gamma.php">gamma phase</a> is over, no more elite galaxy wipes, this is it, Elite Dangerous has finally reached the 2010's era of computer video gaming! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2014-11-22 Gamma or pre-release "Preview" build released.
</p>

<p>
It was very early 2014 (or perhaps late 2013) when I learned about David Braben's kickstarter campaign to fund development of a new Elite game. I was so excited, the 1984 nostalgia mood started to come back.
</p>


	<h2>2012</h2>

<p>
November 2012 Frontier Developments started kickstarter campaign to fund Elite Dangerous developing.
