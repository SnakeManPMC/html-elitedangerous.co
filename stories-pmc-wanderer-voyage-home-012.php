	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

	<h2>2020-06-28 Endless Mining Grind</h2>

<p>
2020-06-28T18:04:46Z Elite back up, we continue endless mining grind... I'm really starting to feel the exhaustion now, I mean the long term one. I feel like I just can't make it back to the bubble with what was it six more 1000t refuels after this.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T19:24:38Z Too tired, my sleeping cycle is completely off, cant keep my eyes open need some sleep...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-28T23:45:37Z New Elite day has started, all refreshen up and ready to mine, we got to get PMC PapaBear back to the bubble.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-29</h2>

<p>
2020-06-29T00:00:24Z Well that was a quick run, ran out of sub surface deposit missiles. Got 249t tritium in cargo, still few limpets left but yeah ran outta missiles, guess I was so bad shot and well the tritium yields are so pitiful compared to LTD triple overlapping hotspot that you run out of missiles before type-9 cargo hold is full.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T00:05:10Z Docked at Blia Aescs OU-X c14-10/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear now has 614t of tritium fuel.
</p>

<p>
Tried to use Spansh carrier plotter but it didn't recognize the system I'm currently at. Yeah the fuel depot is not full yet but I just want to jump one step closer to the bubble I feel so bored of this mining grind. I know in the big picture it doesn't change the amount of tritium I need to mine... but it would just "feel better" to make another jump now.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T01:10:20Z Oh well back to mining...
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T02:18:45Z Found another 4 sub surface deposit asteroid at 65.5km from tritium hotspot, just dunno how far did I drift left/right when flying towards the planet. But this could be pretty decent asteroid to relogin and farm those tritium tons without the need to fly around aimlessly.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T03:08:43Z Okay almost out of sub surface deposit missiles, time to head back to PMC PapaBear to offload. Wonder if I can still find this awesome asteroid the next time.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T03:12:32Z Docked at Blia Aescs OU-X c14-10/KNX-T6F. Offloaded cargo to tritium fuel depot, 919t now, oh nice. Got also 11t of LTDs, too bad nearest station to sell them is ten thousand of light years away heh.
</p>

<p>
While that relogging asteroid position was real nice, as said previously I'm very exhausted with this mining grind, it just feels like overwhelming task which makes me almost to the point of depression (not really but dunno how to explain it otherwise)... so I'm going to plot our next jump right now.
</p>

<p>
In fact I'm going to plot new Spansh carrier route, bookmark it and stick to it no matter what. I find it frustrating like right now Spansh database cannot find this system we are in... its found on nearest system menu but not from the carrier route plotter heh. So I just want to plot a route and keep using it without deviations. Obviously if the designated refuel system has no tritium hotspot that is a problem, but I'll just have to fly my mining ship back and forth to nearest system that has. I am so sick and tired of having no routes coming up, tired of this whole PMC PapaBear and PMC Wanderer traveling, I just want to get back to the bubble and mine some LTDs for credits so I can finally "be set for life". Yes, I'm a LTD gobbling credit whore, muhahaha, sigh? <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
This system has no icy rings and PMC PapaBear is almost out of fuel (cant jump full 500ly anymore). Now I'm off to fly aimlessly around trying to find icy rings, sigh. I am SO BURNT OUT <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T06:27:09Z Found first icy rings in Plaa Aip VD-C b54-6 system.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T08:51:11Z Had been mining in body 3 B for a while now. Forgot to write it down, damn need to code EliteLog to automatically do these texts <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took a quick shower break to refreshen up, then back to mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T09:26:57Z Elite back up, going after the tritium.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T10:07:12Z Docked at Plaa Aip KG-H b51-6/KNX-T6F. PMC PapaBear tritium fuel tank now 325t, should be good for couple of jumps.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-29T10:32:21Z Docked at Plaa Aip CN-S c17-23/KNX-T6F.
