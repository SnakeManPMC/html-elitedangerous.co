	<h2>2018-12-31 New Years Eve</h2>

<p>
2018-12-31T01:09:16Z had to stop playing as I found it difficult to concentrate, that is recipe for a disaster. My eyes felt very tired I had to blink a lot, even though I didnt otherwise feel tired nor did the amount of hours been awake suggest I should be. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
Elite Log session systems visited (FSD jumps): 96, special planets ammonia: 1, earthlike: 1, water: 6, planets smallest: 267.878km, largest: 77253.1km, detail surface scans: 514.

2018-12-31T20:58:58Z started elite up, time for some 2019 new years eve exploration <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Actually I would want to finish this journey and return to sell exploration data as quick as possible, but looking at the waypoints ahead of me I can tell that even with hardcore 300+ day hyper jumping it would still take me several days. No, there is no easy fix for this, you just have to do those jumps and travel until you reach home (well doh! hehe).
</p>

<p>
For the next waypoint 5824ly, 96 hyper jumps to go. Lets continue...
</p>

<p>
2018-12-31T23:46:21Z arrived at Bauloo BO-K c8-11 system which is my ELW bookmark. Had few unexplored bodies here, no specials.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 1299ly, 22 hyper jumps away.
</p>


	<h2>2019-01-01 Happy New Year 2019</h2>

<p>
2019-01-01T00:00:02Z happy new year! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-01-01T00:18:47Z arrived at Oob Chrea LH-Y b28-8 system which is my ELW bookmark. Had several unexplored bodies here, no specials.
</p>

<p>
Next waypoint was 4222ly, 70 hyper jumps away...
</p>

<p>
Except that my Saitek / Logitech X-56 Rhino HOTAS yaw started to pull randomly to the left, even without me touching the stick. This already happened in way smaller scale few days ago, I compensated by increasing the deadzone on the yaw, but today basically around the new year hehe, it broke more or less and kept pulling to the left almost constantly.
</p>

<p>
It pisses me off that X-55 and X-56 are excellent to use, but the production value is garbage, so many issues and failures on these that its ridiculous. I had to return the previous X-55 to warranty and now it seems I have to do the same with this X-56 as well, damnit <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well maybe I'll google the issue tomorrow and ask around on Elite discord, but if nothing comes out of that I guess I need to pack this baby up and return to the store for repair/replacement.
</p>

2019-01-01T00:27:40Z stopped playing due HOTAS yaw breaking up <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
