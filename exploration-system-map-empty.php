What does empty system map look like on undiscovered star system?

PMCTODO above image is missing :(

<p>
The above example image of <b>Sifeae CA-A d130</b> system was taken right after arriving to this star system and doing Full Spectrum System (FSS) scan honk, no other scanning done yet. That is how empty system map of previously undiscovered system looks like.
</p>

<p>
Make note that this is truly a virgin system not discovered or visited by any CMDR before.
</p>

<p>
So if you are exploring, jump into a new star system, FSS honk and take a look at system map, then it looks like that... it means that you are looking for first discoveries on whatever you find in that system.
