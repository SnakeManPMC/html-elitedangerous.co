	<h1>PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story PMC Elite Dangerous</h1>

<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

<p>
2020-06-23T00:01:58Z All tritium bought up, no more cash to put into tritium buy orders, I'm outta money hehe. Carrier balance 2.8 million, personal balance 0 credits haha.
</p>

<p>
PMC Trader 3 has 788t tritium cargo, its good for first fuel transfer. Fuel depot is full 1000t and carriers cargo has 20,275t of tritium.
</p>

<p>
I actually messed it up, that is not enough for trip to PMC Wanderer, fuel transfer and trip back to bubble, at least I don't think it is.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-23T00:16:27Z Plotted route to Byoo Aim EP-R b46-0 system and off we go, this will be about 16hrs trip all jumping & countdown & cooldowns combined.
</p>

<p>
I didn't use Spansh carrier plotter, dunno if that would have been quicker to just copy paste the system names in, well in the end it wouldn't have made much difference mere minutes.
</p>

<p>
So here we are, today's remaining game-play will be plotting new jumps, waiting for the countdowns/cooldowns and in the mean time reading discord, watching youtube videos etc <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Decided after all to plot a route with Spansh carrier plotter, it is in fact much quicker and easier for me to just copy paste the system name into galaxy map and click go heh. <a href="https://spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier/results/BDA856E0-B4E9-11EA-9906-728194EB4526?destination=Byoo%20Aim%20EP-R%20b46-0&market_capacity=21025&module_capacity=750&source=Praea%20Euq%20ZN-J%20b9-3&tritium_fuel=1000&tritium_market=20275" target="_blank">Here is the route I plotted</a>.
</p>

<p>
PMC PapaBear is outfitted with refuel and armory only, so 750t taken from total capacity.
