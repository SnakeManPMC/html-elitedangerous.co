<p>
Next waypoint was 1208ly, 21 hyper jumps away.

<p>
I didn't feel much like doing nothing today, not even playing elite. That is bizarre as day before and yesterday I was almost hyperventilating of how enthusiastic I was to explore... I guess this is the crash and burn thingy now heh. But hey at least I feel like this for everything today not just elite. Anyways funny thing is that I dont have anything else to do so lets explore <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

During this hop I entered into the extremely dense starfield area, it was quite difficult to use FSS as its text is blue and the stars were so bright on the background heh.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-28T20:42:41Z had to stop playing as got quite exhausted all of the sudden. Maybe this is some bigger burnout for exploration jumping again as I've been doing it almost every day for three weeks now.
</p>

Todays exploration session duration 9hrs almost ten hours, so quite weak I think, but yeah...
</p>
