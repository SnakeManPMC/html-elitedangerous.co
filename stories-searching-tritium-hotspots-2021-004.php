<p>
Fleet Carriers use tritium as fuel source, you can mine tritium from icy planetary rings. This is a space exploration story about searching for resource rich tritium rings.

	<h2>2021-03-24 Mining Platinum Triple Overlapping Hotspot</h2>

<p>
2021-03-24T05:12:34Z New elite day has started, elite up with CMDR Snake Man PMC second account selected. Now what are we going to do today...
</p>

<p>
Decided to move PMC PapaBear into the platinum triple overlapping hotspot system, hopefully there are better mining opportunities. This will be 40min task with all the jump timers and cooldowns, the joys of owning a carrier.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T05:32:21Z Docked at Corona Austr. Dark Region AM-L b8-4/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear first jump towards triple platinum overlap hotspot system.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T05:53:19Z Docked at Parrot's Head Sector EL-Y d83/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear arrived to mining system, lets see what we can find from here.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T06:01:24Z Dropped into platinum triple overlapping hotspot, lets mine some.
</p>

<p>
First asteroid prospected 53% platinum content, nice. Looks like we can mine some good tonnage here.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T06:54:00Z Cargo hold and refinery hoppers full. Cargo 205t platinum, 5t painite and 14t palladium.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T06:59:58Z Docked at Parrot's Head Sector EL-Y d83/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear transferred cargo to carrier, then from refinery bins 6t more platinum and 2t palladium. Carrier now 224t platinum, 112t painite, 32t palladium, 1883t tritium and 51 limpets.
</p>

<p>
Then went back to mining right away.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T08:01:19Z Cargo and refinery hoppers full, RTB. 205t platinum and 19t palladium, plus whatever comes out of the refinery hoppers.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T08:06:41Z Docked at Parrot's Head Sector EL-Y d83/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear transferred cargo to carrier, etc. Carrier now 437t platinum, 51t palladium, difference since previous listing.
</p>

<p>
And now I was bored, I really didn't want to go back out to mine some more. Not sure what else to do either though.
</p>

<p>
After short break it was time to continue playing, I still don't know what to do that mining doesn't interest me much because even second account has 9.6 billion credits so where do I need any more heh. But decided to go do one more mining trip while I plan what do I do next.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T09:04:08Z Had to shut down elite for restart because detailed surface scanner did not show hotspots, I could lock onto them but the visual graphics circle was not shown so it was impossible to tell what was the triple overlapping navigation panel item.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T09:09:14Z Dropped to ring and lasers hit the first platinum asteroid.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T09:59:06Z Cargo and refinery hoppers full, we are RTB.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T10:04:19Z Docked at Parrot's Head Sector EL-Y d83/V4F-G4G. PMC PapaBear offloaded all cargo, carrier stats now 645t platinum, 112t painite and 75t palladium.
</p>

<p>
Alright now I'm done with mining, sorry but I'm just bored with it now as it wont change a damn thing with 9.6 billion not to mention if I did this with real account which has 48 billion. I just don't need the credits and my time is better spent doing something else.
</p>

<p>
Taking a short break to stretch my legs and check out how my apartment building repairs are progressing (no further details on that, sorry).
</p>

<p>
Decided to not continue mining. Started to research how much platinum buy order I could create for PMC PapaBear and leave it to this system. The system chat was completely dead so I highly doubt nobody would sell here, but hey the buy order wont cost me a thing so why not.
</p>

<p>
One carrier in this system was buying for 250k/ton and he had over 5.8k demand.
</p>

<p>
So I created platinum buy order for 7998 tons paying 250,047 credits per ton.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T10:27:30Z Shut down elite for CMDR Snake Man PMC. Guess I need to continue using real account but still need to decide what can I do or want to do.
</p>

<p>
Shuffled elite log/journal files around to CMDR Snake Man again, yet I have no clue what to do.
</p>

	<h2>2021-03-24 Back To CMDR Snake Man</h2>

<p>
2021-03-24T10:34:50Z Launched elite back up with real account CMDR Snake Man, no idea what to do but I'm ready for it ;)
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T10:45:03Z Found tritium hotspot at Snake Sector AV-Y c4 11 ring. This is my home system as there is PMC Home World earth like world :)
</p>

<p>
So I had to order PMC Wanderer to jump here orbiting PMC Home World and then go check out how good percentages of tritium those icy asteroids give me :)
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T11:06:13Z Docked at Snake Sector AV-Y c4/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrived to PMC Home World and I docked there to pickup PMC Miner 3, python sub-surface deposit and laser miner ship.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T11:14:28Z Dropped to the tritium hotspot and shot first prospector limpet, tritium 23% nice. Time to mine a bit.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T12:37:30Z Cargo hold and refinery hoppers full, we are RTB again.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T12:43:22Z Docked at Snake Sector AV-Y c4/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer transferred mining cargo to carrier which now has 15t LTD and 844t tritium.
</p>

	<h2>Big Decision To Stop Mining Tritium</h2>

<p>
<b>BIG DECISION TO STOP MINING TRITIUM. I will not mine tritium anymore as it needs to be bought in the bubble.</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes its crazy to mine that mineral because it costs only 51k on average in the bubble while it takes you hour or so to mine 100t of it. Instead you need to mine some platinum or other expensive mineral and then sell that in the bubble and buy tritium.
</p>

<p>
Also exploration trips should be planned so that you can go there and back without needing to refuel. Now obviously with hardcore explorers 30k ly or more out there this is not always possible, but any exploration journey should be carefully planned before hand almost like aircraft flight plan so there are no deviations to it, to save fuel and keeping into the plan.
</p>

<p>
In some very long exploration journeys you have to mine tritium, but that... that... is something I don't even want to think about right now because it really is so painful and useless to mine because you need to buy tritium instead.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T13:12:00Z Lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T13:35:11Z Feeding time over, back to elite. Now I want to setup buy order for tritium to start filling cargo reserves for upcoming exploration journey. No idea what this journey will be or when it starts, but I seriously don't know what else could I do now, not in elite or in real life otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Buying tritium is setting the buy order, then announcing in system chat and hoping traders will start to bring that fuel in.
</p>

<p>
Checked <a href="https://eddb.io/commodity/362" target="_blank">EDDB for tritium prices</a> and looks like Pongo/AntonelliCity has 49.5k / ton and 32.5k ton supply. I'm going to head there in my fast PMC Explorer ship and check out system chat, is it active, are there many carriers, traders, etc.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T13:59:47Z arrived at Pongo system and... nothing, not a single one fleet carrier here and system chat is dead. What is this, huh? :?
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T14:04:25Z Docked at Pongo/Antonelli City. Prices were correct in EDDB, cheap tritium with supply over hundred thousand but there is nobody in this system.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T14:35:43Z Docked at Panoi/Garan Hub. In hopes to find carrier refueling system, but supply was hundred, heh guess nobody refuels here ;)
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T14:51:18Z Docked at Alcor/Macdonald Settlement. Same here, tritium supply is hundred hehe.
</p>

<p>
2021-03-24T14:59:30Z Docked at 61 Cygni/Broglie Terminal. This station has 1.2k supply heh oh wow, I guess I'll stop going through this list and rely on EDDN sent data like EDDB/<a href="tradedangerous.php">Tradedangerous</a>.
</p>

<p>
Was considering just hauling tritium myself but man noway, like 23,000t is 30 trips with trading lakon type-9 ship haha, yeah <b>NO</b>.
</p>

<p>
Got bored to mining and small time exploring, now got FRUSTRATED with tritium buying / hauling, so decided to just shut it down here. I am going to switch to CMDR Snake Man PMC and remove platinum buy order just in case I wont return anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
This was not a rage quit, but rather quick end to my relatively quick elite start for 2021, as explained above I was bored and didn't know what to do because tritium loading for a exploration trip that I would have wanted to do... would be insane 30 loads of trading by myself as apparently in 2021 there is nobody else helping refuel fleet carriers.
</p>

<p>
It was fun little quick elite play through for few days, brought back fond memories from 2020 LTD craze mining and fleet carrier operations, but I guess in a way I really don't want to go back to that mining grind at least not this soon (not even a year has passed yet).
