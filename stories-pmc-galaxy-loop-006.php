	<h2>2016-08-27 Starting All Over Again</h2>

<p>2016-08-27T21:11:12Z started PMC Galaxy Loop all over again. Did preliminary route to EDSM but without coordinates so it is pretty empty shell.
</p>

<p>2016-08-27T21:27:33Z departed from Jameson Memorial.
</p>

<p>At this time in my EliteLog tool I had hyper jumped 15,088 times. It will be really interesting to see how many jumps I'm going to do in this journey before I return to Jameson Memorial again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-08-27T21:31:25Z plotted course and jumped to Ipmil system, PMC Galaxy Loop has BEGUN! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Plan was now to jump using 51.66Ly range to reach the 4000Ly mark where I turned around the... third? time haha, and then continue using economical route from there. Only 21 jumps for 1000Ly hop, gotta love the new jump range <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-08-27T21:52:46Z arrived to Stock 1 Sector KH-V d2-32 so first 1000Ly leg done, man do I love this 51.66Ly jump range hehe.
</p>

<p>2016-08-27T21:58:37Z arrived to Stock 1 Sector JS-T d3-49 which is the first route waypoint (or "leg") in PMC Galaxy Loop. Waypoint I mean just a average random place in the galaxy where I want my journey to proceed, nothing special in this system.
</p>

<p>2016-08-28T00:24:44Z arrived to Sifou NK-L b36-1 system which is 4079Ly from Sol, another thousand light year hop done. This basically marks the spot where I left off earlier. Time to switch back on to economical route plotting and relaxed exploration mood <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>2016-08-28T02:23:10Z arrived to Chraufao SC-V d2-18 where I took a first break, good progress for first session.
