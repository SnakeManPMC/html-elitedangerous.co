<p>2015-10-07T00:37:05Z: arrived to Delkar after outfitting Lakon Type-7 for mining setup in Jameson Memorial. Its time to test mining in brand new v1.4 release. At first attempt of mining I was attacked by AI pirates and I escaped, on second attempt I was destroyed heh. Mining is tough job huh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Mining felt slow with two pulse lasers and two collector controllers, dunno. Yeah it was somewhat good credits when you returned to sell the stuff, but it took hours to mine the stuff so there is just no comparison for trading. Trading is the king.</p>

<p>Purchased Python and outfitted it with mining setup using two mining lasers, works very well. Python seems to be the best overall mining ship now.</p>

<p>Then flew around in populated space exploration ASP gathering market price data using EDMC and typing in distances from star into Maddavo's editstation page. Did also some trading but only little bit.</p>

<p>2015-10-16T16:31:41Z: earlier today we got official v1.5 ships list and Panther Clipper was not there, I'm very sad <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>For this reason I decided that okay now I'm going to concentrate on pure trading trying to reach Elite rank as quick as possible.</p>

<p>Did another run with tweaked ASP to bulletin board smuggling missions, made millions of credits and trade rank increased ten percent or something like that.</p>
