	<h2>2017-10-31 Purchased Second Elite Dangerous Account</h2>

<p>2017-10-31 I was other side of the galaxy but was super eager to do some <a href="eddn.php">EDDN</a> work on populated space, so after several hours (heh hours?) consideration... I purchased second elite dangerous account and started to send market price, station landing pad and distance from star data to EDDN, so taking a quick break from PMC Galaxy Loop for now.
</p>

<p>2017-11-04T01:00:00Z finished sending market prices, kind of achieved everything in populated space with the second account what I planned to do (for now). Have no special desire to get back into exploration jumping frenzy either heh.
</p>

<p>2017-11-07T21:03:21Z back in cockpit and heading towards PMC Galaxy Loop leg 11 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I spent few days working on those populated space stations but now I'm back exploring and motivated getting back quickly to populated space (see pattern here?), I'm not going to do any economical route plotting but just blast off max jump ranges and as quickly as possible. Not that I'm "bored" of exploring, but I am definitely not in a mood for some economical months taking routes now.
</p>

<p>2017-11-08T01:50:37Z jumped into the next system, dropped normally but as soon as that happened the faggot ass stupid fucking HOLO-ME idiot editor opened up and I could not get out of it as it just always opened some new shit options. I could hear fuel scoop already started as my ASP with 100% hull was entering near the star...
</p>

<p>I tried quickly to exit that motherfucking stupid ass holo-me stupidity, but no, it ain't gonna happen.. dropped out of super cruise when hitting the star boundary zone and well yeah, there we go 99% hull integrity.
</p>

<p>Could get back to super cruise without more damage but yeah now my exploration ASP is 99% hull, fuck that pisses me off as it was purely elite glitching with that cocksucking holo-me fucker <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>I have only once started up that stupidity in beta when it was first released, laughed how lame it is and exited right out of it. So now I had no idea how to close it when I had literally few seconds time to spare before my ship gets damaged. For the love of everything that is awesome... why such retarded GUI option is added into the cockpit menus, WHY.
</p>

<p>Every video I put on youtube recorded after this make people believe I'm some newbie retard who cant approach stars and fuel scoop properly, SIGH <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Was thinking of making support ticket because this was caused by holo-me editor opening, but was like... why bother...
