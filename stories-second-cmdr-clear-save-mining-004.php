	<h2>2020-07-02</h2>

<p>
2020-07-02T19:44:18Z New Elite day has started, CMDR Snake Man flying here. Today I'm hoping we could sell our 1.5 million credit LTD supply.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T20:01:25Z Docked at Chacobog/Trinh Enterprise. Checked the system out and it looked like filled with carriers already, good to see so many CMDR's using 3rd party community tools heh. LTD buy price was 1.597 million so I plotted route for PMC Wanderer to get here, set a sell order for 1.560 million per ton. Not a great profit but still.
</p>

<p>
Also its not a great profit for traders, but I bet these get sold. I was looking a bit scary situation when the market prices dropped, so just glad to get these off my hands now and back to trading. Was thinking about the profits a bit more and decided to go with lower buy prices now, I don't care if I won't get the same volume of LTDs sold, but at least I make a decent profit for each one. I'm thinking of paying like 1.1 million per ton now, so there is a nice good profit.
</p>

<p>
That price might get some flak on the system chat, but I don't care, that is what I'm going to try today.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T20:24:56Z Docked at Chacobog/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer has begun selling LTDs for 1.560 millin per ton, wonder how long it takes to offload these.
</p>

<p>
Advertised the selling in fleet carriers owners club and broken limpet discords and system chat of course.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T21:04:53Z Still not a single sell of LTDs, system chat is somewhat quiet, a lot of arrivals and departures but nobody is interested in trading. Inara shows few other carriers selling with lower price than me, that might take away some of my customers.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T21:32:17Z Still nothing, hmm. I wonder if this is just random luck, or is it about the profit, UTC, what... no idea. Yesterday the stuff flew off the cargo racks and now, nothing for over an hour. I'm already thinking of breaking out PMC Trader and go haul that stuff myself.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T21:37:16Z Enough waiting, decided to check inara, found few carriers selling with cheaper price than me, going to break out PMC Trader, buy from those carriers and selling to Trinh Enterprise. Lets make some credits while waiting our cargo to be offloaded heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T22:15:38Z All diamonds sold out. Actually what happened was I went out to buy from another carrier using PMC Trader and then to sell to Trinh Enterprise station, made 37 million per load, easy credits. During my first haul I checked my own carrier because I needed credits to my personal balance and THEN I noticed that like half of the LTD supply was gone already, the stupid fucking GUI just didn't update for me when I was sitting in my carrier deck.
</p>

<p>
Carrier balance now 8.340 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T22:59:07Z Docked at Wikmeang/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer arrived to carrier administration system, here I purchased refuel service as that was really lacking, mining ships need to be refueled.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T23:25:51Z Plotted carrier jump to Col 285 Sector Ah-k a38-2 system, lets get back out there to buy diamonds. Set LTD buy order for 1.346 million per ton total of 3000 tons. I'm hoping by not exceeding 50% of my credit balance the selling by CMDR's works OK.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-02T23:39:56Z Nap time, just no motivation or energy to play at all, hopefully a bit of sleep will fix that.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-03 Python Up To The Gills In Diamonds</h2>

<p>
2020-07-03T03:37:05Z Got some rest, switched to CMDR Snake Man PMC, now its time to go mining with python again. Also advertising that cheap 1.346 million per ton buy price.
</p>

<p>
Got in-game and checked PMC Wanderer stats, I was really surprised to see LTD demand gone down to 2779t so someone had sold 221t already without me even advertising it yet, nice. Maybe there are CMDR's who arent fully aware of the current prices and how markets work. Was thinking of upping that back up to three thousand but decided against it, better to see how it drops down over time without getting the cant sell bug.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T05:21:43Z Finished mining full 224t cargo and 10t in refinery bins, visited two other cmdr carriers with high LTD buying prices... only to find out they are having "cant sell bug", market GUI just offered me 0/0 selling option. Then came to visit PMC Wanderer as I was in the system, its demand is now 1305t so pretty nice 1695t bought so far (since last visit 1474t).
</p>

<p>
Looks like there is no point buying with marginal profits, you have to go at least 250k profit per ton, absolutely no less than 200k. Yes other CMDR's offer better prices so you can't buy with that price very fast, but over time it looks like they trickle in. And its not that bad to buy more than half of the demand within one mining trip.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T05:53:19Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-4/K1G-4XQ. Carriers name was &gt;&gt;LTD1.5M FLEET FETISH heh. Again the "sell bug", could not sell even 4t at once. Sucks.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T06:00:34Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-5/KZZ-23Z. Sold 224t LTDs for 336 million I think because I had to sell them in small increments like 10t at once, then 10t more from refinery bin, credits now 3.115 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T06:17:26Z Started mining.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T07:43:21Z Finished mining, python full up to the gills in diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T07:58:41Z Docked at Col 285 Sector FI-I a39-0/V0V-63Z. Sold 224t LTDs for 337.5 million and then from refinery bins 10t more for 15 million or something, credits now 3.467 billion.
</p>

<p>
Still a ways to go before can buy a fleet carrier, but we're getting there. But now I'm super hungry and neck is stiff from all the trackir5 looking up from pythons cockpit hehe, going to dock with PMC Wanderer to check the demand, then going to take a lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T08:04:33Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-2/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, demand was low as 89t wow nice. Now I need to switch to real account and add another 2000t demand there hopefully that wont trigger the sell bug.
</p>

<p>
Updated buy order for 1600t, lets hope it works ok without "sell bug".
</p>

<p>
While having lunch I was thinking that python has served me well now its getting full loads + refinery bins on every run, cant remember how many runs now but its been several, I'm not getting bored but it just feels like now its time to purchase Lakon Type-9 multi role laser/sub-surface miner ship, this time shield-less and without fuel scoops etc, just hardcore mining ship.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T09:26:06Z Docked at 14 Vulpeculae/Gurragchaa Terminal. Here we should find type-9 plus all the outfitting we need for her.
</p>

<p>
This ship name is PMC Miner 7 with ID PMC-08.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T09:55:25Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2/G4Q-14Z. Phat's LTD shop, refueled and bought limpets. Time to go mining big and HEAVY <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T12:46:38Z Finished mining, cargo hold 630t of LTDs heh. Off to check where could I sell these to highest price as I know PMC Wanderer is pretty much full now.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T12:54:14Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-5/Q3L-95T. Sold 630t of LTDs for 945.3 million, credits now 4.244 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T13:04:17Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-2/Q1L-19Z. At PMC Wanderer, its LTD buy order has been completely fulfilled. It was time to switch to real account and handle some carrier management business there. No idea how many more diamonds I can set as buy order before the "sell bug" appears.
</p>

<p>
Set 844t LTD buy order, it was half the credit balance so should be okay.
</p>

<p>
Then it was lunch break time again <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T16:39:20Z Finished mining. Also noticed forgot to write this stuff down, dunno how many times already today as always too excited to get mining hehe. I really really need to improve EliteLog so it writes this stuff for me, it takes way too much time and focus to write these logs.
</p>

<p>
Okay not completely full cargo but feel somewhat exhausted (and hot, been a hot day today and didn't want to turn on portable air con yet), so decided to head to sell the LTDs. Got 622t total, pretty nice haul.
</p>

<p>
Going to take a look on inara and system chat if someone is advertising a high buy price, hopefully their carriers would actually work.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T16:52:18Z Docked at Col 285 Sector DC-K a38-0/V5Z-TKN. Tried to sell few diamonds in princess of the stars but it had the sell bug.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T17:05:54Z Docked at Col 285 Sector AH-K a38-2/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer, need to switch into real account and fly her to Chacobog/Trinh Enterprise to sell all the goodies including whats left in second account PMC Miner 7 cargo hold.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T17:10:56Z Switched to real account, getting ready to jump the carrier. Oh yeah, buy order for the LTDs was fulfilled, very nice.
</p>

<p>
Managed to plot a jump to Chacobog system, but could not get into close of the selling station as it was filled with carriers.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T17:45:17Z Created sell order for LTDs 5357t at 1.577 million per ton. This is 20k cheaper than in the station, not massive profits for traders but should be enough, my thinking here is that I want to haul that stuff for sell myself to get the maximum credits.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-03 Lost 1.2 Billion In Cargo</h2>

<p>
2020-07-03T17:58:34Z Docked at Chacobog/Trinh Enterprise. PMC Trader docked the first time bringing 790t load of LTDs, it sold for 1.261 million credit. I'm not going to write play-by-play on every docking, I'll try to count them from EliteLog as summary. Okay lets haul some LTDs and get rich <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T18:17:39Z Got fucking interdicted by scripted fake ass retard AI pirate and he destroyed me. There went 1.2 billion in cargo and few million in the ship re-buy. Fuck do I hate that fucking fake AI scripted bullshit system! <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Guess I should just drive the carrier and let other traders take these risks, I mean fuck this one point two BILLION credits went poof because of this fake AI garbage. Fuck this sucks giraffe cock.
</p>

<p>
Last load sold for 985.6 million, credits now 7.291 billion in my personal account, will have to see what PMC Wanderer's balance is when I dock.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T19:07:55Z Docked at Chacobog/Q1L-19Z. Back at PMC Wanderer with all the hauling done. Carriers balance is 8.378 billion after I transferred all the credits from my personal account.
</p>

<p>
Oh wow, its pretty much the same as it was yesterday when going to Col 285 LTD3 rings to buy LTDs... because I fucked up that AI pirate killing me and losing 1.2 billion for no fucking reason.
</p>

<p>
Oh right and now I need to switch to second account and have the type-9 cargo hold sold to station, maybe he has enough credits to buy a carrier now.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T19:17:53Z Okay second account booted up once again, seems I have 568t of LTDs, lets go sell them <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-03 Resurrection Of PMC PapaBear Is Complete</h2>

<p>
2020-07-03T19:22:18Z Docked at Chacobog/Trinh Enterprise. Sold 568t of LTDs for 907.3 million, credits now 5.234 billion! Wohooo! I can now buy fleet carrier for my second account, AGAIN! Buhahahaa <img src="images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T19:36:25Z Switched to real account so I can order PMC Wanderer to jump back to col 285 LTD3 rings and add another buy order there. I must say though, this switching of accounts is getting really old, I mean this is just ... excessive.
</p>

<p>
Plotted jump for PMC Wanderer to Col 285 Sector Gi-i a39-3 system, then set LTD buy order for 3167 tons at 1.346 million/ton. This was about 50% of the credits in my balance, hopefully its enough not to cause the "sell bug" again.
</p>

<p>
Aaaand you guessed it, switching back to second account so we can go buy him an fleet carrier hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T20:03:05Z Docked at Lan Tzak/Jacobi Platform. Quite the long journey on mining outfitted type-9 but it was the ship I was flying heh. In this station we have fleet carrier vendor and I'm going to purchase one.
</p>

<p>
Resurrection of PMC PapaBear is complete! <img src="images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-03T20:13:57Z Shut down Elite, was really tired almost running like with instinct / muscle memory, better get some sleep and continue tomorrow.
