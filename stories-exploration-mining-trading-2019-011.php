	<h2>2019-09-13 Trading With Lakon Type-9</h2>

<p>
2019-09-13T14:50:12Z back in elite, time to take PMC Miner 2 to jameson memorial and do some TradeDangerous trading.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T14:59:22Z docked at jameson memorial. Now I'm considering should I outfit PMC Trader with shields... which goes against all my beliefs since the beginning of the elite, you do not explore with shields, you do not trade with shields. But I do have to admit that yesterday in PMC Miner 2 when I got interdicted and shot at I would have been dead without shields. It just pisses me off that these fake ass retard scripted AI interdictions ruin all the fun of trading/mining.
</p>

<p>
Current PMC Trader outfitting: <a href="https://edsy.org/#/L=FY00000H4C0S20,,,9p310AAe10ARq00AfQ00Aty00B9800BLe00BeE10,,0DI100DI100Bk100AA1008c10072100721005U1005U1003w1002M10,PMC_0Trader,pmc003" target="_blank">edsy.org PMC Trader Specifications</a>.
</p>

<p>
Used TradeDangerous to plot route from jameson to the best trading route in the galaxy starting point which is LP 377-78/Gaspar de Lemos Port, making some credits while enroute there.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790 x Technology/Resonating Separators and plotted course to L 190-21/Gurragchaa Orbital which is 4 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T16:15:12Z docked at L 190-21/Gurragchaa Orbital without incident, not even one pirate on the radio shouting threats, good. Sold cargo for 1.590 million profit. I was instructed to buy Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics but that was (40hrs?) old data as there was no supply. So I plotted route to Ross 85/Mohmand Station with empty cargo hold, its 2 jumps away which will be a cake walk without cargo.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T16:27:39Z docked at Ross 85/Mohmand Station, bought 790 x Medicines/Progenitor Cells and plotted route to LP 320-359/Franklin Terminal which is 4 jumps.
</p>

<p>
Actually now that I think of it... on previous hop I might have made mistake of only looking at SELL section in the commodity market heh, oh well, I'll be more careful from now on.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T16:38:47Z docked at LP 320-359/Franklin Terminal sold cargo for 1.233 million profit. Bought 790 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to LHS 2771/Sarafanov Vision which is 3 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T16:51:44Z docked at LHS 2771/Sarafanov Vision sold cargo for 6.484 million profit. Bought 790 x Consumer Items/Consumer Technology, the price was considerable higher than in TradeDangerous but I still decided to buy them. Plotted route to LP 377-78/Gaspar de Lemos Port which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T17:12:06Z docked at LP 377-78/Gaspar de Lemos Port which is my final destination beginning from jameson memorial, now I am in the best trading route in the galaxy. Sold cargo for 869k profit which is not much but at least didn't have to travel empty. Budget now 4.845 billion.
</p>

<p>
This the best profit route has one hop empty so dunno how it plays out, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Tellus/Ahern Enterprise which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T17:29:29Z docked at Tellus/Ahern Enterprise and sold cargo for 6.538 million profit. Bought 790 x Medicines/Basic Medicines, plotted route to Wolf 412/Borisenko Landing which is 2 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T17:40:49Z docked at Wolf 412/Borisenko Landing and sold cargo for 3.601 million profit. Now I need to hop empty to LP 377-78/Gaspar de Lemos Port which (as empty) is only one jump so rather quick, but still kind of feel useless to travel empty when trading.
</p>

2019-09-13T17:48:39Z docked at LP 377-78/Gaspar de Lemos Port, bought 790 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics and plotted route to Tellus/Ahern Enterprise which is 2 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T17:56:47Z docked at Tellus/Ahern Enterprise and sold cargo for 6.538 million profit.
</p>

<p>
From now on I'm not going to write play-by-play, just interdiction or other special events, if I can keep trading up I'll update budget balance time to time. Its just feels so silly to read every hop info as its mostly copy pasted stuff.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T18:41:16Z still no interdictions, hmm... and as soon as I wrote that I got interdicted, fucking pirate immediately opened fire and did damage for 72% hull status. I don't get it, why are they killers and not pirates, they don't demand any cargo they immediately open fire without any communication?
</p>

<p>
On the next station got 20.6k worth of repairs which is nothing, cost of doing business. But man the shields would definitely protect you a lot and give time to escape, but the amount of cargo space they eat is insane (class 5 shields for type-9).
</p>

<p>
2019-09-13T19:02:46Z exited from elite for lunch time (no bearing on the interdiction btw, just to be clear) and was again pretty bored for trading, I mean when you have 4.8 billion credits and you make 3-6 million profit in average... it kind of feels like you're just spinning your wheels. I'd like to go back start from scratch trading where every credit is important and makes a difference, or to go out on a long exploration journey again.
</p>

<p>
The thing about long exploration journey is that again that gets me bored after few days and the december update is really close so IF the personal fleet carriers get me excited then I need to return in december, which might be too soon or at least make the exploration journey too rushed.
</p>

<p>
Dunno. I'm just bored, heh.
</p>

<p>
After the lunch time, yup I'm bored... was just sitting trying to think what do I want to do in elite, what *can* I do... All I could come up with was that exploration journey before december, or just until further notice as it really depends how the personal fleet carriers turn out feature wise. So I decided to go exploring, no plan whatsoever just heading towards north east direction, no idea where to go from there. I just want to be in the black and explore new systems, discover earth-likes, water worlds and other special planets.
</p>

<p>
So off to fly PMC Trader back to jameson memorial once again heh.
