	<h2>2021-04-01 Second Mining Trip Conclusion</h2>

<p>
2021-04-01T15:26:04Z Elite back up, today we do that planned second tritium mining test, python full of minerals.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T15:32:43Z Dropped into the rings, first prospector drone fired.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:08:49Z Got 100t tritium in cargo.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:32:52Z One hour is up! Cargo now 176t.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:52:42Z Ran out of limpets, I had 150 which I considered a lot, guess not then.
</p>

<p>
On this test run I discarded all &lt;15% asteroids for laser mining and while I did use pulse wave analyzer to hunt down sub-surface deposits, I was mainly focusing on laser mining.
</p>

<p>
Current tritium status: 224t cargo hold and 1t in the refinery hopper, so got pretty close to full.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T16:57:24Z Docked at Phae Flaae OU-B b54-1/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer unloaded cargo to tritium depot, aaand got black adder transaction error disconnect again same as yesterday hehe. So reconnected and took one ton from carriers cargo and put it back to make refinery bin spit out its contents, then put it to tritium depot.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer tritium depot now 698t.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-01T17:00:03Z Shut down Elite, need to cook food and decide what else I'm going to do today, unfortunately that most likely wont be playing elite... dunno just don't feel like continuing anymore today.
</p>

<p>
I actually logged back in and shut down carriers services, JUST in case I decided to take longer than week break...
</p>

<p>
The End.
</p>
