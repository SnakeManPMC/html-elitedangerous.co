<p>
2019-09-15T15:56:59Z new trading day has started, back in sidewinder cockpit. Last night I ended up with balance 406k credits.
</p>

<p>
Bought 16 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics and plotted route to Aulin/Kuo City which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
On destination got pirate threats on the radio comms, or at least I think they were directed at me "Almost there!" or some other crap, I already locked i Bootis on nav computer so I can high wake jump out, but luckily I managed to escape into destination station before any interdiction commenced. Hopefully this first hop (possible) interdiction is not a sign of things to come heh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T16:04:49Z docked at Aulin/Kuo City, sold cargo for 67k profit, refueled 54cr. Bought 16 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Dahan/Nelson Works which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T16:16:19Z docked at Dahan/Nelson Works, sold cargo for 79.9k profit, refueled 53cr. This concludes the current tradedangerous route I plotted, balance 553.4k wow pretty nice with only a pesky sidewinder <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
My first ship purchase is just around the corner, fully trading outfitted adder costs 601k so I need to make few more trade hops to get that cash, so lets continue.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T16:39:25Z docked at Dahan/Nelson Works, sold cargo for 80k profit, refueled 24cr. Balance 648.9k, this is enough to buy fully trade outfitted adder and even leaves me few thousands seed money to start trading with it. Now the guestion is, where can I buy adder with all the modules I need, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T17:00:27Z docked at Dahan Gateway, sold all modules from sidewinder, then bought my first new ship, Adder <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
Took a break to edit currently captured videos (had to make elite dangerous intro/outro), then calculated new tradedangerous route of 10 hops which came out just nicely over the cobra mk3 purchase amount. The route though has two stations with 25 and 34 days old data which concerns me, but lets hope for the best.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I am not bored, but have to admit that right now this trading feels kind of like "work". I am motivated to do it so I can buy cobra which will be cool ship to fly and profits go up a notch again, but maybe its just this adder which is so lame ship to fly I don't know heh. Well sure I guess somewhere deep down there is slight shred of boredom as well, but very very little.
</p>

<p>
Also because I'm writing this story you are reading right now and <a href="https://github.com/SnakeManPMC/elite-EliteLog" target="_blank">Elite Log</a> does not provide me copy pasteable templates for all the station activities, it gets a bit old to copy paste that stuff several times on each station visit. Really need to upgrade Elite Log so it would write this story station parts automatically, I mean as you can tell its pretty template copy paste stuff where only few values change on each station. Also wonder how boring this stuff is to read several years from now heh.
</p>

<p>
Bought 30 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Ross 41/Ham Dock, which is 5 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T20:50:05Z docked at Ross 41/Ham Dock, sold cargo for 253.1k profit, refueled 78cr. Bought 30 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Rasmussen/Fort Forgie Starport, which is 3 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T20:57:57Z docked at Rasmussen/Fort Forgie Starport, sold cargo for 218.7k profit, refueled 36cr. Balance 2.064 million, enough to buy cobra mk3 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So purchased cobra mk3 and outfitted it as best as I could in this station, still missing few parts and I'll go buy them at Baxbakaeris/Stillman Station.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T21:31:17Z docked at Baxbakaeris/Stillman Station, refueled 10cr. Then off to outfit those few last modules <a href="https://is.gd/IMcN1Q" target="_blank">EDSY.org Cobra Mk3</a>
</p>

<p>
Bought 64 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Zhi/Metcalf Hub, which is 6 jumps. But once I did my first jump I realized that all this time the galaxy map route plotting has been on economy mode heh.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T21:47:18Z docked at Zhi/Metcalf Hub, sold cargo for 185.1k profit, refueled 103cr. Bought 64 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Rasmussen/Fort Forgie Starport, which is one jump.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T21:54:30Z docked at Rasmussen/Fort Forgie Starport, sold cargo for 483.5k profit, refueled 134cr.
</p>

<p>
Time to update tradedangerous, calculate new 10 hop route and have a lunch break <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T22:23:40Z lunch break is over but tradedangerous is still calculating galaxys best trade route for my cobra mk3's specifications, man that takes forever. Plan is now to relocate into where this route is, I'm not longer limited by jump range like in starter sidewinder.
</p>

<p>
This new route starts at Comaucate/Kahn's Folly which is 208ly from my current location, alright lets travel there and make some credits. It was 9 jumps away but my cobra requires refuel, so will have to see where I stop to top off.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T22:39:14Z docked at LTT 420/Truman Landing, refueled 739cr. Then we continue the last part of this route.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T22:44:05Z arrived at Comaucate system. Then proceeded to dock at Kahn's Folly which was my destination.
</p>

<p>
Bought 64 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Armo/Stromgren Survey, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T22:55:06Z docked at Armo/Stromgren Survey, sold cargo for 553.6k profit, refueled 117cr.
</p>

<p>
Got trade rank promotion to Merchant! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Bought 64 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, which is one jump.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T23:03:13Z docked at Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, sold cargo for 544.9k profit, refueled 154cr.
</p>

<p>
Then was time to calculate a new trading route. Bought 64 x Legal Drugs/Liquor, plotted route to Galouri/Bahcall Horizons, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T23:25:55Z docked at Galouri/Bahcall Horizons, sold cargo for 18.3k profit, refueled 262cr. Bought 64 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Karama/Kotzebue Barracks, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T23:33:17Z docked at Karama/Kotzebue Barracks, sold cargo for 593.7k profit, refueled 107cr. Balance 3.011 million.
</p>

<p>
3 million in cash which means I can now purchase lakon type-6 ship, that is another step to the higher cargo capacity. According to eddb closest station selling this configuration is HIP 111478/Kelly Hub, so off we go.
</p>

<p>
It feels like I didn't get much time with cobra mk3 which I really like, kind of shame. Sure I could have traded more, but the goal here is to get as good progress as possible, so to the next bigger ship we switch as soon as we have the credits.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-15T23:46:17Z docked at HIP 111478/Kelly Hub, lets purchase Lakon Type-6 Transporter. <a href="https://is.gd/uHDBun" target="_blank">EDSY.org Lakon Type-6</a>
</p>

<p>
Departed to the best small/medium landing pad with planets trade route, it was like 100ly away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T00:17:44Z docked at Comaucate/Kahn's Folly, refueled 450cr. Bought 114 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Armo/Stromgren Survey, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
Got interdicted in the destination system, pirate started to shoot and put my hull to 74% status.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T00:27:10Z docked at Armo/Stromgren Survey, sold cargo for 916.5k profit, refueled 184cr, repaired 644cr. Bought 114 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T00:38:31Z docked at Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, sold cargo for 970.7k profit, refueled 114cr.
</p>

<p>
Jumped empty from kaang wa to Comaucate, nothing to trade. I really don't like this super profitable hops 1 and 2 but empty number 3, but.. well.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T00:49:41Z docked at Comaucate/Kahn's Folly, Bought 114 x Textiles/Military Grade Fabrics, plotted route to Armo/Stromgren Survey, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T00:56:47Z docked at Armo/Stromgren Survey, sold cargo for 909.7k profit, refueled 140cr. Bought 114 x Industrial Materials/Polymers, plotted route to Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, which is 2 jumps.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T01:04:43Z docked at Kaang Wa/Thomas Dock, sold cargo for 970.7k profit, refueled 114cr.
</p>

<p>
Radio comms bugged so that it always said "1" new message even though I did read all the messages, pissed me off so restarted elite and actually got up and walked around a bit to stretch my legs, just a few minutes long break here.
</p>

<p>
Oh and as there is fair bit to go now to next ship upgrade, I believe more than 10 million credits, I'm going to stop writing these copy paste loop route entries and only write if something interesting happens until its time to purchase the new ship. Like said before, those almost identical copy pastes are no fun to read.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T01:58:55Z docked at Smei Ti/Dalton Refinery, this is now tradedangerous --ls-max 1000 --no-planet best trade route, lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T02:21:18Z it was a pretty good route, fast and easy. Of course this also had one empty hop as well, I'm going to try to calculate some loop routes now, would feel much more efficient to have every hop profitable.
</p>

<p>
Also going to take another short break, kind of difficult to concentrate playing, restless, dunno if its getting bored hmm.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-16T03:51:00Z after several more trade runs balance 13.931 million credits. Still more than 10 million to go for next ship upgrade heh. Trading is hard work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to call it a night here, basically take yet another break but when that break would be over, its already my bed time so lets call it a night. Was a good trading day thats for sure.
</p>

<p>
