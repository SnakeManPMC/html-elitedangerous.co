<p>2015-11-24T02:28:21Z: Today we started at Jameson Memorial where we left off last night, time to go pickup our combat anaconda from empire space using another taxi hauler, then off to nearest compromised navigation beacon for some elite ship killing.</p>

<p>2015-11-24T03:21:24Z: Arrived to HIP 11131 system, nearest compromised navigation beacon to my starting location. Now we'll get to see how the combat is with anaconda in there.</p>

<p>2015-11-24T15:36:00Z: End of the day was Deadly 40% rank.</p>

<p>Purchased taxi Hauler and went to cash in bounty vouchers on couple of systems as they were already millions. Went to cash in Rhibonii system at Komarov Base outpost which was 125,000Ls from the star, ugh! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Found pretty decent system at Hecate, its large pad station is 525Ls away from the star, quick and easy to go rearm, repair and as well cash in bounty vouchers there.</p>

<p>2015-11-25T14:48:31Z: End of the day was Deadly 50% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-26T17:10:19Z: End of the day was Deadly 58% rank.</p>

<p>2015-11-27T08:11:44Z: once again got 6000cr murder bounty, was too trigger happy in the heat of combat to shoot 4% hull anaconda... but forgot to check that hes wanted. Hoh. 6 days bounty on my head now and this Hecate system was so great for compromised navigation beacon combat with the station so close. Damn.</p>

<p>2015-11-27T17:07:17Z: End of the day was Deadly 70% rank.</p>
