	<h2>2019-09-11 Trading With Lakon Type-9</h2>

<p>
2019-09-11T13:35:27Z new day has started, back at elite, docked in Jameson Memorial.
</p>

	<h2>Trading With Lakon Type-9</h2>

<p>
Took out PMC Trader which is my good old Lakon Type-9, sold the supercruise assist whatever newbie module and purchased massive 2t cargo rack, now my total capacity is 790t <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
As I planned last night now its time to trade using eddb multi hop trading thing because TradeDangerous currently is not working in my linux.
</p>

<p>
PLAN: Purchased resonating separators. Filtered galaxy map for non anarchy systems and plotted route to LP 888-62 which was many jumps away, so I surely made a eddb trading newbie mistake with the hops and distance, these settings are way too long for profitable trading.
</p>

<p>
Even with non anarchy systems I got interdicted, so I submitted, throttle to zero waiting, no demands just threats and then he opened fire, huh? Didn't even check what ship it was, police also arrived to the scene but I high wake jumped out of there. He managed to damage me to 84% hull status.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T14:06:52Z arrived at BU 741 system, then docked at Starport Alpha to refuel. I wanted to repair the damage but this starport had no repair facility heh. From this refuel stop I still have 6 jumps to the destination system.
</p>

<p>
Two systems down the route... AI fake ass scripted stupid retard interdiction, he started to shoot me immediately and shot some coocoo land kiddie crap engineered weapons (I heard thermal attack) and got my FSD offline among other things, then just fucking destroyed me.
</p>

<p>
Strange enough I did not rage quit, I was just "oh well, Elite Dangerous Trading 2019." heh, I actually went back to eddb, adjusted the settings and continued multi hop trading route from there. Obviously if this shit continues endlessly that on every trade route you get killed, face 3.4 million rebuy and lost who knows how many million in cargo... yes why the fuck would anyone in their right mind do stupid shit like this.
</p>

<p>
Bought basic medicines, plotted route to Dierites which was 2 jumps away (no non anarchy filtering anymore), now we have a better trading route specifications.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T14:30:00Z docked at Leoniceno City station, sold 790x basic medicines for 249.6k profit. Bought 790x military grade fabrics, plotted route to Ghimr/Kingsmill Hub which was just a one jump.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T14:38:54Z docked at Kingsmill Hub and sold 790x military grade fabrics for 6.357 million profit! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x beryllium, plotted route to Malannher/Khan City, 4 jumps away. On the first system got pirate shouting threats in radio comms but I managed to jump before the interdiction started.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T14:55:42Z docked at Khan City and sold 790x beryllium for 975.6k profit.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x military grade fabrics, plotted route to Ghimr/Kingsmill Hub, 4 jumps away. So now eddb starts to loop back to the profitable system, I believe there was option for no loops but it didn't seem to work in grand scheme of things, yes it avoids loops but doesn't avoid coming back to profitable system like in my case just here now.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T15:17:25Z docked at Kingsmill Hub and sold 790x military grade fabrics for 6.251 million profit.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x beryllium, plotted route to Malannher/Khan City, 4 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T15:29:19Z docked at Khan City and sold 790x beryllium for 962.2k profit.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x military grade fabrics, plotted route to Ghimr/Kingsmill Hub, 4 jumps away. Here you see the repetitive copy paste loop continuing. Honestly I ALREADY feel a little bit bored hammering back and forth with these two stations selling the same cargo. I actually bookmarked these two stations for easier/quicker route plotting.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T15:45:29Z docked at Kingsmill Hub and sold 790x military grade fabrics for 6.245 million profit. Budget now 4.315 billion.
</p>

<p>
With this trade run complete I decided to pick a new one, actually I'm going to google research if I could fix my TradeDangerous install, maybe contact the current developer in community developers (EDCD) discord or something. Its always been clear that eddb just ain't a proper trading tool, nothing even compares to TradeDangerous it is light years ahead of the competition. But obviously that means nothing if the fucking thing doesn't work <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to use eddb loop finder, plotted route to Panorua, 7 jumps which I do with an empty ship.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T16:35:30Z docked at Panorua/Xiaoguan City. Bought 790x polymers, plotted route to Cromovii system which was 4 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T16:47:14Z docked at Cromovii/Dall Horizons and sold 790x polymers for 7.076 million profit.
</p>

<p>
Tried to install TradeDangerous to PMC Gaming machine, but no go, getting the same error as in PMC Linux machine so the current github version is broken.
</p>

<p>
Back to eddb multi hop trading, snif. Bought 790x basic medicines, plotted route to Panorua/Xiaoguan City, 4 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T17:27:37Z docked at Panorua/Xiaoguan City and sold 790x basic medicines for 214.8k profit.
</p>

<p>
Realized that this multi hop trade route is much worse than the loop route. Was really frustrated with eddb trading (as usual) so decided to give TradeDangerous install one more try, because the latest version is broken... lets try older one. So I checked out some changelogs, used common logic, then downloaded v10.4.8 from release archives and aayeah it was working in PMC Linux python 3.5.2 setup! Man was I happy <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Got database all updated and excellent trade routes calculated, lets trade! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T19:23:50Z docked at Panorua/Marconi Orbital, bought 790x military grade fabrics, plotted route to Ida Dhor/Vancouver Gateway, which was 2 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T19:32:22Z docked at Ida Dhor/Vancouver Gateway and sold 790x military grade fabrics for 3.569 million profit.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x Consumer Technology, plotted route to Panorua/Xiaoguan City which is 2 jumps away.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T19:45:18Z docked at Panorua/Xiaoguan City and sold 790x consumer technology for 1.395 million profit.
</p>

<p>
Bought 790x polymers, plotted route to Irula/Anderson Orbital which is only a jump away. When departing my type-9 collided with something, no idea what it was as I could not see anyone above or side of me, got 90% hull status, oh well.
</p>

<p>
2019-09-11T19:55:14Z docked at Irula/Anderson Orbital and sold 790x polymers for 4.041 million profit. Budget now 4.332 billion.
</p>

<p>
The collision got me 7.7k credit repairs.
</p>

<p>
After some time tinkering with TradeDangerous I decided to go EDDN send market data for the "olddata" systems and see if those gets updated nearly in real time.
