<p>2015-11-19T06:59:10Z: End of the day was Deadly 10% rank.</p>

<p>Did some conflict zone combat today as I felt frustrated in hazardous RES while getting only lower combat ranking ships and of course the usual down times when waiting for ships to appear. However the conflict zone wasnt that hot either, very few elite ships and even deadly's were rare.</p>

<p>2015-11-20T08:11:56Z: End of the day was Deadly 15% rank.</p>

<p>Was careless in conflict zone and had my anaconda blown up. Heh 4+ ships started to shoot at me and I had the nerve to try to repel them, big mistake. Anytime such number of ships open up on you, its time to jump away.</p>

<p>2015-11-21T11:27:17Z: End of the day was Deadly 22% rank.</p>

<p>New day of combat but didn't feel like playing at all, before I even started PMC Gaming computer I felt like blah combat. But I tried, one set of conflict zone but had to again escape by hyper jumping as single (1) ASP with rail gun brought my shields down while I was engaging dangerous python.
<br><br>
My doctrine is now that if my shields go down I drop everything and immediately jump into hyperspace which has no mass-lock to delay the jump to safety.
<br><br>
It really pays off to select a star system to jump into at the first thing you do while entering into conflict zone, I've had to use hyper jump escape now like the last four times in conflict zones.</p>

<p>2015-11-21T22:26:11Z: End of the day was Deadly 23% rank.</p>

<p>New day and some conflict zone combat, but under 5mins had to jump away as another 4-5 ships opened up on me taking down my shields and before I managed to jump away, hull to about 50% status. Back to hazardous RES, baby.</p>

<p>Got frustrated to the complete lack of elite or even more than few rare deadly ships in the hazardous RES. Decided to move into pristine reserves metallic ring system in A Lavigny-Duval control space. Some people say pristine reserves metallic rings have the best ship selections. We'll see...</p>

<p>2015-11-22T15:21:51Z: End of the day was Deadly 28% rank.</p>
