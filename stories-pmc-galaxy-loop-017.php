	<h2>2017-10-29 Arrived At Beagle Point</h2>

<p>2017-10-29T14:43:10Z arrived at Beagle Point <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Jumped two systems further away, but that was as far as my ASP 51.67 light year jump range allowed (no I'm not interested with FSD material boost things). Arrived at Ceeckia FZ-D d13-0 system in 2017-10-29T15:18:33Z.
</p>

<p>I must admit, arriving to beagle point was totally "blah" lackluster experience to me, I got there and literally was like "yawn.. umm okay, so what now", heh. Now don't get me wrong, I took my time to drop my ASP out of supercruise, stopped and just watched silently the whole galaxy in front of my eyes... it was definitely sight worth traveling 65,000 light years <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>It was quite demanding to travel the last leg of that trip all in one go so when getting there I thought it will take few days before I start to head back... but it was already the next day when I was eager to get going towards the populated space.
