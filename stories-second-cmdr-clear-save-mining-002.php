	<h2>2020-06-30</h2>

<p>
2020-06-30T23:07:06Z New Elite day has started, we got some LTDs to mine!
</p>

<p>
Dropped into LTD3 mines and went for 25.5km to the 4 sub surface deposit asteroid, got 68t of LTDs out of it even with few drill mishaps. Nice start for this mining day.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-01 Fat Cat Full Of Diamonds</h2>

<p>
2020-07-01T00:14:38Z Docked at Col 285 Sector DC-K a38-1/JLX-WKG. Tranquillity was buying LTDs for 1.5 million each, so sold them 68t for 102.4 million, credits now 761.4 million.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T01:39:27Z Docked at Parenni/Alvares City. Sold 81t LTDs for 133.5 million, credits now 895.6 million.
</p>

<p>
And guess what, nap time as I almost fell asleep mining previously, cant afford to slam my shield-less python into asteroid.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T04:14:45Z Nap over. Now can we finally do one full 224t cargo load with python or not?
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T04:18:56Z Docked at Parenni/H5K-2QZ. Found a carrier departing pretty quickly, The Absolution.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T04:53:52Z Dropped into col 285 LTD 3 ring, now I am going to mine 224t of diamonds, full cargo hold, or die trying...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T07:04:14Z Ran out of limpets, got 184t LTDs and as by-product 4t tritium. I had like hmm 100 or so limpets when I departed, so hmm next time I need 150 limpets it might be a bit better reserve.
</p>

<p>
Now off to find a carrier who buys LTDs or regular carrier trip to Parenni.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T07:12:14Z Docked at Col 285 Sector DC-K a38-4/K1H-W3V. Anzi Miner Corp. Sold 184t LTDs for 276.1 million, credits now 1.171 BILLION <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Plan was initially to buy Lakon Type-9 sub surface miner as soon as possible for those crazy loads, however I am having so much fun flying this extremely fast and maneuvrable python (compared to type-9) and the fact that I haven't done single full cargo load yet in it... I am going to continue mining on the python. Once I start to haul full loads every time, then it might be type-9 upgrade time.
</p>

<p>
So back to the LTD3 rings and lets keep mining...
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T07:29:19Z Docked at Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-2/V0L-04B. Docked Promethius and bought 160t limpets (went for one fifty but overshot).
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T07:38:49Z Started mining. Now hopefully we get out of this will cargo full of minerals.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T09:08:17Z Cargo hold is full! Okay not full of LTDs but the inventory is now 211t LTDs and 13t tritium with refinery bins full of LTD fragments.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T09:13:08Z Docked at Col 285 Sector DC-K a38-4/K1H-W3V. Sold 211t LTDs for 316.6 million, then 10t more was processed by refinery and I sold those for 15 million, credits now 1.503 billion.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T09:35:18Z Back in the LTD3 ring, starting prospecting, lets get some diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T11:38:38Z Cargo hold full of LTDs same refinery bins, fat cat flies home <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But now I need to take a lunch break, what a great timing after such nice mining session.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T13:02:12Z Lunch break over. But during feeding I made a decision to switch to real CMDR Snake Man and put a LTD buy order, then if miners sell to PMC Wanderer I could take the LTDs and go sell to a high paying station or park there and make a sell order. Anyways point being I'm quickly going to setup that now.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-01 PMC Wanderer Joins The Fun</h2>

<p>
2020-07-01T13:06:28Z Switched to CMDR Snake Man, PMC Wanderer. Its fully fueled, cargo hold 2151t LTDs and 2052t tritium. I put some millions into carriers bank account so its now 4 billion even.
</p>

<p>
Decided to put 1.5 million buy order for 2665 tons.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T13:37:04Z LTD stock 2151t so already 514t bought and its only been like damn ten or so minutes! <img src="images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I put the advertisement on fleet carriers owners club discord buy-sell-orders channel and pasted ONCE into Col 285 Sector Cc-k a38-2 system chat, ONCE...
</p>

<p>
Also here is interesting thought, when CMDR Snake Man PMC is mining to "his" second fleet carrier... he would go to sell into PMC Wanderer, get credits and... CMDR Snake Man gets more sales/LTDs... umm yes? right, heh? what? huh? <img src="images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T13:58:25Z Exited Elite, going to switch back to CMDR Snake Man PMC and go mine some more while advertising in system chat <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-01 Pesky "Sell Bug"</h2>

<p>
2020-07-01T14:29:57Z Switched back to CMDR Snake Man PMC, lets mine some diamonds.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T14:35:21Z Docked at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-4/Q1L-19Z. PMC Wanderer <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was trying to sell LTDs but ... nothing happened when I clicked sell button. I've had this reported to me back when refueling tritium to PMC PapaBear, the CMDRs had to sell like 20-30 tons per sell for it to work. So now I tried various amounts even 1t but nothing worked.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T15:34:12Z Finally got it working by switching back to real account and tweaking the buy order, had to set it well lower than what my current budget is. I'm suspecting the buy order creation bugs out if you allow the "slider" to go all the way to the right (difficult to explain). Anyways its fixed, PMC Wanderer is buying LTDs now.
</p>

<p>
Sold 224t LTDs for my own 1.5 million per ton price for 336.1 million, credits now 1.855 billion. Getting close to that two billion mark heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T17:14:19Z Was getting so tired I froze up few times when piloting, that is very dangerous in a asteroid field. Decided to call it a night, going to sell the load I have now and exit. Current cargo 140t LTDs.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T17:23:40Z Docked at PMC Wanderer, but all the demand was gone, heh all 1500 something there was left. Okay need to switch to real account and add more demand, I really hope I don't have to stay up to go sell this stuff tonight hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T17:30:59Z Switched to real account and yeah all the LTD buy order had been fullfilled, ok time to add some more. Currently 4151t LTDs in cargo (heh).
</p>

<p>
Need to add tritium donate order as well, one CMDR asked about it in system chat.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-01T17:39:07Z Added all buy orders I could afford, for LTD demand 772t and 40t of tritium with galactic average price. Tomorrow when I wake up PMC Wanderer will be flown to the best selling station where I make sell order just below the station buying price, then annouce it on the system and obviously its shown in EDDN using sites too so hopefully stuff gets sold out quickly and then I'll be a rich man, ready to begin another day of LTD pimpin' <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways for now, I'm off, time to get some sleep I cant keep my eyes open anymore, it was a great Elite day and hopefully tomorrow will be even better! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
