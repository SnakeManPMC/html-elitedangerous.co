2020-06-19T01:28:35Z Called it a night, its been a long day and just don't have mental energy to continue. Actually I didn't even plan on taxiing miners today but it just happened.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T17:26:36Z New Elite day has started.
</p>

<p>
Today I decided to do some mining, not just continue the old mining but to go for the Corona Austr. Dark Region OX-U b2-3 6 which I have not checked out yet.
</p>

<p>
Took my diamondback explorer to Hirpinyi/Altshuller Gateway, checked tritium info out and yes looks like 10k supply and 44k market price, I can do that. Lets bring the carrier over here and start refueling it. Sent a call in system chat but it was dead, nobody replied.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T20:48:26Z Finished refueling some time ago already, tritium in cargo now 5,516t which is quite nice amount for populated space. Turned off tritium commodity market, nobody donated, nobody was in the system chat, it was a dead system.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-19T20:55:22Z Arrived at Col 285 Sector GI-I a39-3.
</p>

<p>
Got an another crazy idea which I wanted to develop and now I'm ending this second account mining for fleet carrier game-play here, I'm sure I'll return it one day.
