	<h2>2020-07-09 Waiting For LTD Prices To Rise</h2>

<p>
2020-07-09T07:40:52Z New Elite day has started. Well actually I logged in 06:55 hrs just to suspend carrier services before thursdays weekly server maintenance. I enabled them again now heh.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at yesterdays agenda, I did basically all but returning and doing tweaks for the current ships. Like said PMC NOP eagle is too slow, way too slow, and deep core mining is useless waste of time. I'm going to keep seismic charge launchers and abrasion blasters in PMC Wanderer outfitting just so I can use them if I get so bored, but I definitely will not be doing regular core cracking.
</p>

<p>
Todays agenda? Uhm I don't know, waiting for LTD prices to increase and perhaps take a look how much grinding would engineering PMC NOP's thrusters be. Guess I'll go back to sub-surface deposit mining in col 285 LTD 3 rings, back to hammer some diamonds.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer stats, tritium depot 384t, cargo hold 11,229t LTDs and 1745t of tritium.
</p>

<p>
Plotted route back to col 285 LTD 3 rings.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T09:42:55Z Elite back up, lets go check out new possible LTD highest selling location on Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5.
</p>

	<h2>2020-07-09 LTD Prices Back Up</h2>

<p>
2020-07-09T10:03:00Z We found it, 1450t demand with 1.6 million per ton price, awesome. OK its not full 1.7 million but I'll take one six any day of the week as its been so long mere one point one.
</p>

<p>
I quickly sent PMC Wanderer and PMC PapaBear to this system heh.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T10:31:23Z Set sell order for 11,229t of LTDs for 1.628 million per ton. I don't think many will take that offer, but its there anyways, I'll start to manually haul stuff for sell.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T10:41:20Z Docked at Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5/Rix Depot. Took PMC Trader with 370t of LTDs to sell, did hit the 25% bulk tax mark just a bit so got only 1.636 million per ton so total of 605.4 million. Will have to take next load with less than three seventy.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T10:52:43Z Docked at Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5/Rix Depot. Now with 360t cargo I got the full 1.648 million per ton price, total sell payout 593.3 million credits.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be hauling these 360t loads now ... until I get bored or ran out of diamonds <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T10:59:28Z Switched to second account so I can set sell order for PMC PapaBear as well, maybe even jump it nearer to the sell station. Created LTD sell order for 3138t for same 1.628 million per ton. Also jumped it to planet 2.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T11:07:25Z Switched back to real account, now lets continue hauling until we have nothing to haul! <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
At this point I tried to advertise PMC carriers selling LTDs for 1.628 million per ton, but the system chat was completely dead, there was nothing but my adverts and one other guy commented few words. So I stopped advertising, the carrier info is on inara/eddb so if someone wants to trade they'll find them. Its just that, there are nobody here.
</p>

<p>
All the other carrier CMDR's jumped ship (pun intended) to the new 1.6 million system which has 3200t demand so there is no bulk tax penalty for large ships. Carriers just disappeared in mass from system map and system chat went dead after about 20min. Sad to see.
</p>

<p>
Next time when new high selling price comes along, check the demand. If demand / 4 is less than your cargo capacity... its a bad place to sell.
</p>

<p>
Sure I understand that if you have been waiting for days before good sell price comes its tempting to go for it, but man hauling 360t per load is just brutal torture as there are NO other CMDR's trading in this system, I've had 0 tons sold from PMC Wanderer so far and by the looks of the system chat... it wont sell any before I've hauled everything away myself, and then I do the same for PMC PapaBear.
</p>

<p>
Next time, don't hesitate to go for better selling system as too low demand system just is not worth it.

</p>

<p>
Going to take a lunch break now.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T14:43:48Z Lunch break over, lets get back to hauling diamonds. Decided to try to install Elite on PMC DevSurf (my editing / surfing main computer), run CMDR Snake Man PMC from there, wing up with... err me, then second account cmdr would get 5% wing dividends every time I sell half a billion worth of diamonds.
</p>

<p>
Picked up 360t, remaining in carrier 5099t.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T16:18:29Z Got CMDR Snake Man PMC to join me in multi crew, sold 360t of LTDs and he got 29.6 million dividends hehe.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T16:22:09Z Docked at Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5/Q1L-19Z. Someone has bought some diamonds as current cargo is 5099t. Good.
</p>

<p>
Saw on system chat that CMDR Drumline from Vitsol Orbital is selling LTDs for 1.25 million per ton, well hell I'll take those profits, quick hop into his carrier and indeed he had like fifteen hundred tons of them, I bought first 790t load then went to pick up the rest, like 433t remaining. Called him on local chat but no reply, guess he was not in the system or playing.
</p>

<p>
2020-07-09T16:49:22Z Docked at Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5/Q1L-19Z. Dumped second load of LTDs to PMC Wanderer so that I left 360t onboard, lets continue our regular selling operations. Carrier current cargo 5962t.

<p>
2020-07-09T21:48:12Z Time to shut it down, I'm absolutely exhaustd of hauling diamonds ALL DAY today... uuh.
</p>

<p>
I was so tired I didn't even bother to check how much credits do I have, there is time for that tomorrow. Now I'm going to take a nice cool shower and get ready for a good night sleep, I feel like I'm going to sleep forever after this exhausting hauling session.
