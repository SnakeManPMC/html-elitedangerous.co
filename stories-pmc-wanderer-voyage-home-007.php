<p>
PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Story for Elite Dangerous, my fleet carrier "PMC Wanderer" was something like 40,000 light years from the populated space towards "north east", then I decided to bring the carrier to Col 285 Low Temperature Diamonds mines, this is the story how that voyage unfolded.

<p>
PMC PapaBear carrier balance 2.888 million, weekly upkeep currently already 12.775 million. I need a lot of cash so the carrier wont go to negative balance next thursday morning. I'm going to have buy tritium using PMC Wanderer's PMC Trader ship, which I had to do anyways.
</p>

<p>
Going to transfer 10,000t of tritium from PMC PapaBear to PMC Wanderer by selling them. If the sell price is 289 credits per ton that already covers the 2.888 million. So most likely I cannot even put sell price that low due the 1000% above/below market price thing.
</p>

<p>
With 10k tons of tritium onboard plus full fuel depot here is <a href="https://www.spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier/results/E59FBED8-B573-11EA-B94C-FE7494EB4526?destination=Col%20285%20Sector%20CC-K%20a38-2&market_capacity=10000&module_capacity=550&source=Byoo%20Aim%20EP-R%20b46-0&tritium_fuel=1000&tritium_market=10000" target="_blank">PMC Wanderer's return route</a>.

2020-06-23T18:48:43Z Suddenly someone called me on system chat. Hum, system chat? in middle of nowhere here? Heh yeah indeed it was a CMDR from the LTD triple overlap system from few days ago when I was taxiing them back and forth to selling stations.
</p>

<p>
He did not stay on the carrier but it was his last docking station, he then went to mine and got his ship blown up so hes rebuy brought him to PMC PapaBear which was like 15k ly out from the bubble hehe.

<p>
The last jump in this journey unfortunately has to be done blind, CMDR Snake Man PMC doesn't have scan data for this system, hopefully the carriers wont be located very far apart so tritium hauling wont be like 2000ls distance.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-23 PMC PapaBear Has Arrived</h2>

<p>
2020-06-23T23:24:22Z Docked at Byoo Aim EP-R b46-0/KNX-T6F.
</p>

<p>
Aah finally arrived to our destination! Yeah! <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
We were dropped around orbit of the main star but at the far end of that orbit, so we are now 1300ls away from PMC Wanderer which is not too bad but definitely takes minute or so to super cruise. Oh well could not be helped and I'm not going to waste 40min to jump out and jump back in to get next to her.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-23T23:29:02Z Set a sell order for 11,000t of tritium so we can get PMC Wanderer refueled. Not sure what was I thinking a total brain fart... but now when I sell these 11k tons out... PMC PapaBear is left with nothing, it will be stranded here.
</p>

<p>
Oh man what a mess, how the fuck could I make a mistake like that. I calculated all that shizzle with Spansh plotter that I have enough fuel... just completely forgot to note that yeah PMC PapaBear is empty when refueling is done. Oh well, lesson learned once again, I wont be making this mistake ever again.
</p>

<p>
So now its time to shut down CMDR Snake Man PMC Elite client, switch out netlogs/journals and start up CMDR Snake Man and start buying that tritium for its voyage home.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-23T23:35:06Z Started Elite with CMDR Snake Man real account, aayeah lets get this done.
</p>

<p>
Switched to PMC Trader and departed to buy some tritium from PMC PapaBear, on quick calculation that with 790t per trip it will take me 14 trips to haul it all. Lets get started.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-23T23:50:49Z First 790t load delivered. Looks like the super cruising is a bit over a minute, plus all the decelerating and docking etc. This will take a while, but we'll get it done.

	<h2>2020-06-24 PMC Wanderer Refueled</h2>

<p>
2020-06-24T03:06:32Z Finished transferring tritium from PMC PapaBear to PMC Wanderer, all 11,000t hauled over.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer now has total of 10,450t of tritium in cargo plus fuel depot full 1000t. Should be plenty enough to reach the bubble.
</p>

<p>
But... now we wait for CMDR FirehawkGT to wake up in 0611hrs as he promised. That is still three hours away, hmm. Such a waste of time as I could have jumped who knows how many times in all those hours. I could go mining I guess, but it just feels so silly as I'm all dressed up and ready to go... but have to wait for someone else. Also there is the fear that what if this guy never shows up, then I have wasted three perfectly good hours just sitting at my hands here.
</p>

<p>
PMC Wanderer total cargo 26t LTDs, 10,450t tritium and 419t limpets. Actually I loaded up those limpets into PMC Trader so they wont cause excess weight to PMC Wanderer's fuel usage.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T03:22:27Z I'm not going to sit here waiting so I'm going to once again launch CMDR Snake Man PMC, take out sub surface miner ship and go mine some tritium, at least for hour or maybe two dunno, hopefully until CMDR FirehawkGT comes online.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T03:26:32Z Okay CMDR Snake Man PMC loaded up.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T04:06:52Z Nvidia drivers crashed twice in relatively short time, decided to reboot whole computer.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T05:09:14Z Shut down Elite, took a aircon install break.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T05:42:20Z Elite back up, more mining while waiting <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T06:09:13Z Another nvidia driver crash, sigh. Wonder if its the heat in my room, I doubt it as this was already happening before the heatwave started.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T06:33:24Z CMDR FirehawkGT got online and boarded PMC Wanderer, I shut Elite down for aircon install.
</p>

	<h2>2020-06-24 PMC Wanderer Voyage Home Continues</h2>

<p>
2020-06-24T08:10:27Z Started Elite back up with CMDR Snake Man, now we continue PMC Wanderer voyage home. Next hyper jump plotted.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty tired already dunno how many hours I can stay up, but lets see one hyper jump at the time.
</p>

<p>
2020-06-24T09:28:45Z Dead tired need some sleep, have to call it a night here.
