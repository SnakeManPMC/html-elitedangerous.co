	<h2>Signal Sources</h2>

<p>
In your ships cockpit, left side panel, navigation tab you often times can find signal sources. You also see these in 3D space when you super cruise or fly around, they appear in the heads up display (HUD) circles with light seconds or mega meters distance.
</p>

<p>
When you do Full Spectrum System (FSS) scan in populated space you almost always see signals, for example degraded emissions.
</p>

2025-05-03T21:35:59Z In one of these degraded emissions navigation panel contacts I found a wreckage, apparently ship wreckage and then several <b>MATERIALS</b> floating which you could collect with cargo scoop (or collector limpets if you had any).
