Combat<br>
Bounties claimed: 171<br>
Combat bonds: 10<br>
Total kills: 181<br><br>

Trading<br>
451,1 million<br><br>

Exploring<br>
12,3 million
</p>

<p>Combat Elite ranking is 8750 kills. OnePercent did 600 kills a day which is 14.5 days to achieve. I have 181 kills so I need 8569 more which is 14.2 days if I could keep 600 kills per day like OnePercent.</p>

<p>Trading Elite ranking is 1013 million traded. I have 451,1 so need 561,9 million. I can trade 10 million a day which is 56.1 days! :(</p>

<p>Okay so I have to trade at least 20 million per day which is 28 days, heh a month of straigh up trading then? ehhh, the horror... the horror ;)</p>

<p>Exploration Elite ranking is 119,9 million. I have 12,3 million so I need 107.6 million. Impossible to say how many millions you can make in a day as exploration usually is several days straight out in wild.</p>

<p>Time it takes to triple Elite<br>
1) exploration 7 days???<br>
2) trading 28 days :(<br>
3) combat 14 days<br>
total 49 days, ETA May 22nd, maybe ;)</p>

<p>Really rough date estimates. Apr 10th exploration elite. May 8th, trading elite. May 22nd, combat elite.</p>

<p>Timeline / diary<br>
Exploration:<br>
03-27-15: read OnePercent triple Elite interview in newsletter and got inspired.<br>
03-28-15: started exploring, only maybe 1000Ly away from populated space.<br>
2015-03-28T23:42:02Z<br>
2015-03-30T00:24:13Z: stop to unload first batch of exploration data at TSU, then proceeded to explore. Went to north armerica, cave and NGC 7822 nebulas. Then decided to go check out galactic core (not sagittarius a* specifically but just the center core).<br>
04-03-15: continuing towards sagittarius a* galactic center. Sagittarius A* at 2015-04-03T23:44:48Z<br>
04-04-15: 1955hrs decided to come back to populated space so could sell the exploration data. 25,586Ly traveling ahead of me ;)<br>
2015-04-05T16:43:23Z: journey continues from 15,533Ly point towards populated space. Traveling at 1,000Ly up in galaxy plane.<br>
2015-04-06T03:52:17Z: at Droju sector had to (first time?) re-plot my route as there were so many unscoopable dwarf stars :(<br>
2015-04-06T06:50:16Z: arrived at Snake Sector YV-M b7-5 :)<br>
2015-04-06T07:23:38Z: arrived at Tsu and docked to Ziemkiewicz Ring. Journey is over, time to sell exploration data :)</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 27,303,155 and after 64,599,494 so made total of 37,296,339 credits. Spend time selling this cartography data 1h 21min hehe. I was really disappointed that it was THIS LOW amount, I already said if its under 50 million I will be disappointed and I secretly wished I rank up to Elite with over 100 million profit with one go... boy, was I wrong or what, huh! :(</p>

<p>04-06-15 status:<br>
Exploring<br>
49,6 million</p>

<p>2015-04-06T23:01:49Z: Decided to go out -970,-1040,1030 coordinates and start neutron star scanning.<br>
2015-04-07T08:35:37Z: arrived at Tsu and docked to Ziemkiewicz Ring.</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 64,599,486 and after 67,965,896 so made total of 3,366,410 credits. This was after 36 system visits but with focus on scanning neutron stars.</p>

<p>04-07-15 status:<br>
Exploring<br>
53,0 million</p>

<p>2015-04-07T10:51:34Z: arrived to Shinrarta Dezhra do kit exploring Anaconda for 39.35Ly jump range, then went to 2000Ly test drive ;)<br>
2015-04-07T12:51:10Z: arrived to Shinrarta Dezhra. Test drive was ok but ASP is still the best exploring ship, no doubt.</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 34,464,966 and after 35,140,002 so made total of 675,036 credits. This was about 2000Ly trip.</p>

<p>04-07-15 status:<br>
Exploring<br>
53,7 million</p>

<p>2015-04-07T23:22:50Z: was in Tsu system and left to explore ("south of sol" hehe).<br>
2015-04-08T01:39:47Z: arrived about 1000Ly away from Tsu at Wredguia XL-W c2-1. Started exploring closest systems.<br>
2015-04-08T08:26:17Z: arrived at Tsu system to sell cartography data.</p>

<p>Credits before selling exploration data: 35,139,553 and after 37,792,636 so made total of 2,653,083 credits.</p>

<p>04-08-15 status:<br>
Exploring<br>
56,4 million</p>

<p>2015-04-08T09:54:32Z: left Tsu to go explore neutron star fields 10-12,000Ly from Sol, for approx week I guess ;)<br>
2015-04-08T22:53:57Z: after sleep travel continues, not yet even close to the neutron star fields.<br>
2015-04-08T23:30:09Z: arrived at Bleae Thua VN-D c27-3, only grid coord 500 up in the galactic plane.<br>
2015-04-09T03:58:22Z: arrived at Traikaae KJ-O d7-0, the first neutron star in this journey. Not even close where I'm heading though.<br>
Soon after noticed my Saitek X55 HOTAS K1 button is broken, decided to call into the shop and ask should I send it to warranty or not. If so, then dunno if I break out my Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS or play with keyboard and mouse instead.<br>
2015-04-09T05:49:38Z: stopped for feeding break and to handle that HOTAS business. Had to ship HOTAS into repairs, tried to play using keyboard + mouse some training missions but it felt so weird heh, todays exploring momentum came to a halt.<br>
2015-04-09T23:15:00Z: tried playing with Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS but holy smokes it was stiff stick, my muscles were sore after playing for 3 minutes! Not to mention I barely could destroy training basic combat sidewinder, ouch :) I want my Saitek X55 back! :(<br>
2015-04-10T04:21:01Z: did final check with Thrustmaster Warthog but its so stiff and cant get the buttons to configure like in X55 so I decided to continue playing with keyboard and mouse until X55 comes back from repairs.<br>
2015-04-10T04:47:52Z: call it quits for now, I just cant get the feeling and touch back by using keyboard. I'm constantly struggling to control my ship and scared shitless that slightest mistake causes my ship to get destroyed.</p>

<p>2015-04-14T10:21:50Z: Had a weekend off as my Saitek X55 was under warranty repair, today I got brand new in un-opened box delivered to me! :)<br>
I cant tell you how happy I was when I get to play elite again with proper HOTAS. I continued my journey from Byua Euq EW-E c14-0 system.<br>
2015-04-16T07:28:15Z: arrived at Bleae Aescs TS-A d1-140 system which is located in nice dense neutron star field. Now starts one week of surface scanning neutron stars and water/earth like worlds :)<br>
2015-04-17T15:50:01Z: decided to head one or two thousand light years further towards the core as I felt like running light on neutron stars at my current location. Deeper into galaxy we go!</p>


<p>04-23-15, Thursday; youre done with neutron stars, head back to populated space! :-)</p>

<p>Exploring systems in one day, record 497, but very good day is above 400. You're lazy is its below 150. Basically 31 jumps is 1,000Ly.</p>
