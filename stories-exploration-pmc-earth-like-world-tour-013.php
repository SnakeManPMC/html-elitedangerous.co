</p>

<p>
It felt good to be back in my Asp cockpit in other side of the galaxy exploring, last two days was spent watching tv which was indeed good break from elite but it was good to take a few days breather as I've been playing every day since dec 7th I think.
</p>

<p>
2018-12-24T03:37:28Z checked my codex first reported discovery of drymans point earth like world, still undiscovered. Guess nobody is interested of stealing that discovery as its been already over a week.

<p>
2018-12-24T04:09:02Z had to call it quits as I was falling a sleep in front of the computer. Only slept like 6hrs last night and now felt super tired.
